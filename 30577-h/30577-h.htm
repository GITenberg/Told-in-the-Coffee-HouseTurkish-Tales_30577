<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>In the course of a number of visits to Constantinople,
I became much interested in the
tales that are told in the coffee houses. These
are usually little more than rooms, with walls
made of small panes of glass. The furniture
consists of a tripod with a contrivance for holding
the kettle, and a fire to keep the coffee
boiling. A carpeted bench traverses the entire
length of the room. This is occupied by turbaned
Turks, their legs folded under them,
smoking nargilehs or chibooks or cigarettes,
and sipping coffee. A few will be engaged in a
game of backgammon, but the majority enter
into conversation, at first only in syllables, which
gradually gives rise to a general discussion.
Finally, some sage of the neighborhood comes
in, and the company appeals to him to settle
the point at issue. This he usually does by
telling a story to illustrate his opinion. Some
of the stories told on these occasions are adaptations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
of those already known in Arabic and
Persian literature, but the Turkish mind gives
them a new setting and a peculiar philosophy.
They are characteristic of the habits, customs,
and methods of thought of the people, and for
this reason seem worthy of preservation.</p>

<p>Two of these tales have been taken from
the Armenian, and were received from Dr. K.
Ohannassian of Constantinople. For one, <i>The
Merciful Khan</i>, I am indebted to Mr. George
Kennan. None of them has been translated
from any book or manuscript, and all are, as
nearly as practicable, in the form in which they
are usually narrated. Most of the stories have
been collected by Mr. Allan Ramsay, who, by
a long residence in Constantinople, has had
special opportunities for learning to know the
modern Turk. It is due to him, however, to
say that for the style and editing he is in no
wise responsible, and that all sins of omission
and commission must be laid at my door.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_THE_HODJA_SAVED_ALLAH" id="HOW_THE_HODJA_SAVED_ALLAH"></a>HOW THE HODJA SAVED ALLAH</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/ncap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="N" title="N" />
</div><p>ot far from the famous Mosque
Bayezid an old Hodja kept a
school, and very skilfully he taught
the rising generation the everlasting
lesson from the Book of Books. Such
knowledge had he of human nature that by
a glance at his pupil he could at once tell
how long it would take him to learn a quarter
of the Koran. He was known over the
whole Empire as the best reciter and imparter
of the Sacred Writings of the Prophet.
For many years this Hodja, famed far and
wide as the Hodja of Hodjas, had taught in
this little school. The number of times he
had recited the Book with his pupils is beyond
counting; and should we attempt to
consider how often he must have corrected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
them for some misplaced word, our beards
would grow gray in the endeavor.</p>

<p>Swaying to and fro one day as fast as his
old age would let him, and reciting to his
pupils the latter part of one of the chapters,
Bakara, divine inspiration opened his inward
eye and led him to pause at the following
sentence: "And he that spends his money in
the ways of Allah is likened unto a grain of
wheat that brings forth seven sheaves, and in
each sheaf an hundred grains; and Allah
giveth twofold unto whom He pleaseth." As
his pupils, one after the other, recited this
verse to him, he wondered why he had overlooked
its meaning for so many years. Fully
convinced that anything either given to Allah,
or in the way that He proposes, was an
investment that brought a percentage undreamed
of in known commerce, he dismissed
his pupils, and putting his hand into
his bosom drew forth from the many folds of
his dress a bag, and proceeded to count his
worldly possessions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Carefully and attentively he counted and
then recounted his money, and found that if
invested in the ways of Allah it would bring
a return of no less than one thousand piasters.</p>

<p>"Think of it," said the Hodja to himself,
"one thousand piasters! One thousand piasters!
Mashallah! a fortune."</p>

<p>So, having dismissed his school, he sallied
forth, his bag of money in his hand, and
began distributing its contents to the needy
that he met in the highways. Ere many
hours had passed the whole of his savings was
gone. The Hodja was very happy; for now
he was the creditor in Allah's books for one
thousand piasters.</p>

<p>He returned to his house and ate his evening
meal of bread and olives, and was content.</p>

<p>The next day came. The thousand piasters
had not yet arrived. He ate his bread, he
imagined he had olives, and was content.</p>

<p>The third day came. The old Hodja had
no bread and he had no olives. He suffered
the pangs of hunger. So when the end of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
day had come, and his pupils had departed to
their homes, the Hodja, with a full heart and
an empty stomach, walked out of the town,
and soon got beyond the city walls.</p>

<p>There, where no one could hear him, he
lamented his sad fate, and the great calamity
that had befallen him in his old age.</p>

<p>What sin had he committed? What great
wrong had his ancestors done, that the wrath
of the Almighty had thus fallen on him, when
his earthly course was well-nigh run?</p>

<p>"Ya! Allah! Allah!" he cried, and beat
his breast.</p>

<p>As if in answer to his cry, the howl of the
dreaded Fakir Dervish came over across the
plain. In those days the Fakir Dervish was
a terror in the land. He knocked at the door,
and it was opened. He asked, and received
food. If refused, life often paid the penalty.</p>

<p>The Hodja's lamentations were now greater
than ever; for should the Dervish ask him for
food and the Hodja have nothing to give, he
would certainly be killed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
"Allah! Allah! Allah! Guide me now.
Protect one of your faithful followers," cried
the frightened Hodja, and he looked around
to see if there was any one to rescue him from
his perilous position. But not a soul was to
be seen, and the walls of the city were five
miles distant. Just then the howl of the Dervish
again reached his ear, and in terror he
flew, he knew not whither. As luck would
have it he came upon a tree, up which, although
stiff from age and weak from want,
the Hodja, with wonderful agility, scrambled
and, trembling like a leaf, awaited his
fate.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the howling Dervish,
till at last his long hair could be seen
floating in the air, as with rapid strides
he preceded the wind upon his endless
journey.</p>

<p>On and on he came, his wild yell sending
the blood, from very fear, to unknown parts of
the poor Hodja's body and leaving his face as
yellow as a melon.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
To his utter dismay, the Hodja saw the Dervish
approach the tree and sit down under its
shade.</p>

<p>Sighing deeply, the Dervish said in a loud
voice, "Why have I come into this world?
Why were my forefathers born? Why was
anybody born? Oh, Allah! Oh, Allah! What
have you done! Misery! Misery! Nothing
but misery to mankind and everything living.
Shall I not be avenged for all the misery my
father and my father's fathers have suffered?
I shall be avenged."</p>

<p>Striking his chest a loud blow, as if to emphasize
the decision he had come to, the Dervish
took a small bag that lay by his side, and
slowly proceeded to untie the leather strings
that bound it. Bringing forth from it a small
image, he gazed at it a moment and then addressed
it in the following terms:</p>

<p>"You, Job! you bore much; you have written
a book in which your history is recorded;
you have earned the reputation of being the
most patient man that ever lived; yet I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
read your history and found that when real
affliction oppressed you, you cursed God.
You have made men believe, too, that there
is a reward in this life for all the afflictions
they suffer. You have misled mankind. For
these sins no one has ever punished you.
Now I will punish you," and taking his long,
curved sword in his hand he cut off the head
of the figure.</p>

<p>The Dervish bent forward, took another
image and, gazing upon it with a contemptuous
smile, thus addressed it:</p>

<p>"David, David, singer of songs of peace in
this world and in the world to come, I have
read your sayings in which you counsel men to
lead a righteous life for the sake of the reward
which they are to receive. I have
learned that you have misled your fellow-mortals
with your songs of peace and joy. I
have read your history, and I find that you
have committed many sins. For these sins
and for misleading your fellowmen you have
never been punished. Now I will punish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
you," and taking his sword in his hand he cut
off David's head.</p>

<p>Again the Dervish bent forward and brought
forth an image which he addressed as follows:</p>

<p>"You, Solomon, are reputed to have been
the wisest man that ever lived. You had
command over the host of the Genii and
could control the legion of the demons. They
came at the bidding of your signet ring, and
they trembled at the mysterious names to
which you gave utterance. You understood
every living thing. The speech of the beasts
of the field, of the birds of the air, of the
insects of the earth, and of the fishes of the
sea, was known unto you. Yet when I read
your history I found that in spite of the vast
knowledge that was vouchsafed unto you, you
committed many wrongs and did many foolish
things, which in the end brought misery
into the world and destruction unto your people;
and for all these no one has ever punished
you. Now I will punish you," and
taking his sword he cut off Solomon's head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Again the Dervish bent forward and brought
forth from the bag another figure, which he
addressed thus:</p>

<p>"Jesus, Jesus, prophet of God, you came
into this world to atone, by giving your blood,
for the sins of mankind and to bring unto
them a religion of peace. You founded a
church, whose history I have studied, and I
see that it set fathers against their children
and brethren against one another; that it
brought strife into the world; that the lives
of men and women and children were sacrificed
so that the rivers ran red with blood unto
the seas. Truly you were a great prophet, but
the misery you caused must be avenged. For
it no one has yet punished you. Now I will
punish you," and he took his sword and cut
off Jesus' head.</p>

<p>With a sorrowful face the Dervish bent forward
and brought forth another image from
the bag.</p>

<p>"Mohammed," he said, "I have slain Job,
David, Solomon, and Jesus.  What shall I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
do with you? After the followers of Jesus
had shed much blood, their religion spread
over the world, was acceptable unto man, and
the nations were at peace. Then you came
into the world, and you brought a new religion,
and father rose against father, and brother
rose against brother; hatred was sown between
your followers and the followers of Jesus, and
again the rivers ran red with blood unto the
seas; and you have not been punished. For
this I will punish you. By the beard of my
forefathers, whose blood was made to flow
in your cause, you too must die," and with
a blow the head of Mohammed fell to the
ground.</p>

<p>Then the Dervish prostrated himself to
the earth, and after a silent prayer rose and
brought forth from the bag the last figure.
Reverently he bowed to it, and then he addressed
it as follows:</p>

<p>"Oh, Allah! The Allah of Allahs. There
is but one Allah, and thou art He. I have
slain Job, David, Solomon, Jesus, and Mo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>hammed
for the folly that they have brought
into the world. Thou, God, art all powerful.
All men are thy children, thou createst them
and bringest them into the world. The
thoughts that they think are thy thoughts.
If all these men have brought all this evil
into the world, it is thy fault. Shall I punish
them and allow thee to go unhurt? No. I
must punish thee also," and he raised his
sword to strike.</p>

<p>As the sword circled in the air the Hodja,
secreted in the tree, forgot the fear in which
he stood of the Dervish. In the excitement
of the moment he cried out in a loud tone of
voice: "Stop! Stop! He owes me one thousand
piasters."</p>

<p>The Dervish reeled and fell senseless to the
ground. The Hodja was overcome at his own
words and trembled with fear, convinced that
his last hour had arrived. The Dervish lay
stretched upon his back on the grass like one
dead. At last the Hodja took courage.
Breaking a twig from off the tree, he threw it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
down upon the Dervish's face, but the Dervish
made no sign. The Hodja took more courage,
removed one of his heavy outer shoes
and threw it on the outstretched figure of the
Dervish, but still the Dervish lay motionless.
The Hodja carefully climbed down the tree,
gave the body of the Dervish a kick, and
climbed back again, and still the Dervish did
not stir. At length the Hodja descended from
the tree and placed his ear to the Dervish's
heart. It did not beat. The Dervish was dead.</p>

<p>"Ah, well," said the Hodja, "at least I shall
not starve. I will take his garments and sell
them and buy me some bread."</p>

<p>The Hodja commenced to remove the Dervish's
garments. As he took off his belt he
found that it was heavy. He opened it, and
saw that it contained gold. He counted
the gold and found that it was exactly one
thousand piasters.</p>

<p>The Hodja turned his face toward Mecca
and raising his eyes to heaven said, "Oh
God, you have kept your promise, but," he
added, "not before I saved your life."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/tcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p>here lived in Constantinople an
old Hodja, a learned man, who
had a son. The boy followed in
his father's footsteps, went every
day to the Mosque Aya Sofia, seated himself
in a secluded spot, to the left of the pillar
bearing the impress of the Conqueror's hand,
and engaged in the study of the Koran. Daily
he might be seen seated, swaying his body to
and fro, and reciting to himself the verses of
the Holy Book.</p>

<p>The dearest wish of a Mohammedan theological
student is to be able to recite the entire
Koran by heart. Many years are spent in
memorizing the Holy Book, which must be
recited with a prescribed cantillation, and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
acquiring a rhythmical movement of the body
which accompanies the chant.</p>

<p>When Abdul, for that was the young man's
name, had reached his nineteenth year, he had,
by the most assiduous study, finally succeeded
in mastering three-fourths of the Koran. At
this achievement his pride rose, his ambition
was fired, and he determined to become a
great man.</p>

<p>The day that he reached this decision he
did not go to the Mosque, but stopped at home,
in his father's house, and sat staring at the fire
burning in the grate. Several times the father
asked:</p>

<p>"My son, what do you see in the fire?"</p>

<p>And each time the son answered:</p>

<p>"Nothing, father."</p>

<p>He was very young; he could not see.</p>

<p>Finally, the young man picked up courage
and gave expression to his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Father," he said, "I wish to become a
great man."</p>

<p>"That is very easy," said the father.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
"And to be a great man," continued the son,
"I must first go to Mecca." For no Mohammedan
priest or theologian, or even layman,
has fulfilled all of the cardinal precepts
of his faith unless he has made the pilgrimage
to the Holy City.</p>

<p>To his son's last observation the father
blandly replied: "It is very easy to go to
Mecca."</p>

<p>"How, easy?" asked the son. "On the
contrary, it is very difficult; for the journey
is costly, and I have no money."</p>

<p>"Listen, my son," said the father. "You
must become a scribe, the writer of the thoughts
of your brethren, and your fortune is made."</p>

<p>"But I have not even the implements necessary
for a scribe," said the son.</p>

<p>"All that can be easily arranged," said the
father; "your grandfather had an ink-horn;
I will give it you; I will buy you some
writing-paper, and we will get you a box to
sit in; all that you need to do is to sit still,
look wise and your fortune is made."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
And indeed the advice was good. For
letter-writing is an art which only the few
possess. The ability to write by no means
carries with it the ability to compose. Epistolary
genius is rare.</p>

<p>Abdul was much rejoiced at the counsel that
had been given him, and lost no time in carrying
out the plan. He took his grandfather's
ink-horn, the paper his father bought, got himself
a box and began his career as a scribe.</p>

<p>Abdul was a child, he knew nothing, but
deeming himself wise he sought to surpass the
counsel of his father.</p>

<p>"To look wise," he said, "is not sufficient;
I must have some other attraction."</p>

<p>And after much thought he hit upon the
following idea. Over his box he painted a
legend: "The wisdom of man is greater than
the wisdom of woman." People thought the
sign very clever, customers came, the young
Hodja took in many piasters and he was correspondingly
happy.</p>

<p>This sign one day attracted the eyes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
mind of a Hanoum (Turkish lady). Seeing
that Abdul was a manly youth, she went to him
and said:</p>

<p>"Hodja, I have a difficult letter to write.
I have heard that thou art very wise, so I
have come to thee. To write the letter thou
wilt need all thy wit. Moreover, the letter
is a long one, and I cannot stand here
while it is being written. Come to my Konak
(house) at three this afternoon, and we will
write the letter."</p>

<p>The Hodja was overcome with admiration
for his fair client, and surprised at the invitation.
He was enchanted, his heart beat
wildly, and so great was his agitation that his
reply of acquiescence was scarcely audible.</p>

<p>The invitation had more than the charm of
novelty to make it attractive. He had never
talked with a woman outside of his own family
circle. To be admitted to a lady's house was
in itself an adventure.</p>

<p>Long before the appointed time, the young
Hodja&mdash;impetuous youth&mdash;gathered together<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
his reeds, ink, and sand. With feverish step
he wended his way to the house. Lattices
covered the windows, a high wall surrounded
the garden, and a ponderous gate barred the
entrance. Thrice he raised the massive
knocker.</p>

<p>"Who is there?" called a voice from within.</p>

<p>"The scribe," was the reply.</p>

<p>"It is well," said the porter; the gate was
unbarred, and the Hodja permitted to enter.
Directly he was ushered into the apartment of
his fair client.</p>

<p>The lady welcomed him cordially.</p>

<p>"Ah! Hodja Effendi, I am glad to see you;
pray sit down."</p>

<p>The Hodja nervously pulled out his writing-implements.</p>

<p>"Do not be in such a hurry," said the lady.
"Refresh yourself; take a cup of coffee, smoke
a cigarette, and we will write the letter afterwards."</p>

<p>So he lit a cigarette, drank a cup of coffee,
and they fell to talking.  Time flew; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
minutes seemed like seconds, and the hours
were as minutes. While they were thus enjoying
themselves there suddenly came a heavy
knock at the gate.</p>

<p>"It is my husband, the Pasha," cried the
lady. "What shall I do? If he finds you
here, he will kill you! I am so frightened."</p>

<p>The Hodja was frightened too. Again there
came a knock at the gate.</p>

<p>"I have it," and taking Abdul by the arm,
she said, "you must get into the box," indicating
a large chest in the room. "Quick, quick,
if you prize your life utter not a word, and
Inshallah I will save you."</p>

<p>Abdul now, too late, saw his folly. It was
his want of experience; but driven by the sense
of danger, he entered the chest; the lady locked
it and took the key.</p>

<p>A moment afterwards the Pasha came in.</p>

<p>"I am very tired," he said; "bring me
coffee and a chibook."</p>

<p>"Good evening, Pasha Effendi," said the lady.
"Sit down. I have something to tell you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
"Bah!" said the Pasha; "I want none of
your woman's talk; 'the hair of woman is long,
and her wits are short,' says the proverb. Bring
me my pipe."</p>

<p>"But, Pasha Effendi," said the lady, "I
have had an adventure to-day."</p>

<p>"Bah!" said the Pasha; "what adventure
can a woman have&mdash;forgot to paint your eyebrows
or color your nails, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, Pasha Effendi. Be patient, and I will
tell you. I went out to-day to write a letter."</p>

<p>"A letter?" said the Pasha; "to whom would
you write a letter?"</p>

<p>"Be patient," she said, "and I will tell you
my story. So I came to the box of a young
scribe with beautiful eyes."</p>

<p>"A young man with beautiful eyes," shouted
the Pasha. "Where is he? I'll kill him!"
and he drew his sword.</p>

<p>The Hodja in the chest heard every word
and trembled in every limb.</p>

<p>"Be patient, Pasha Effendi; I said I had an
adventure, and you did not believe me. I told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the young man that the letter was long, and I
could not stand in the street to write it. So
I asked him to come and see me this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Here? to this house?" thundered the
Pasha.</p>

<p>"Yes, Pasha Effendi," said the lady. "So
the Hodja came here, and I gave him coffee
and a cigarette, and we talked, and the minutes
seemed like seconds, and the hours were
as minutes. All at once came your knock
at the gate, and I said to the Hodja, 'That is
the Pasha; and if he finds you here, he will kill
you.'"</p>

<p>"And I will kill him," screamed the Pasha,
"where is he?"</p>

<p>"Be patient, Pasha Effendi," said the lady,
"and I will tell you. When you knocked a
second time, I suddenly thought of the chest,
and I put the Hodja in."</p>

<p>"Let me at him!" screamed the Pasha.
"I'll cut off his head!"</p>

<p>"O Pasha," she said, "what a hurry you are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in to slay this comely youth. He is your prey;
he cannot escape you. The youth is not only
in the box, but it is locked, and the key is in
my pocket. Here it is."</p>

<p>The lady walked over to the Pasha, stretched
out her hand and gave him the key.</p>

<p>As he took it, she said:</p>

<p>"Philopena!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" said the Pasha, in disgust. He threw
the key on the floor and left the harem, slamming
the door behind him.</p>

<p>After he had gone, the lady took up the key,
unlocked the door, and let out the trembling
Hodja.</p>

<p>"Go now, Hodja, to your box," she said.
"Take down your sign and write instead: 'The
wit of woman is twofold the wit of man,' for I
am a woman, and in one day I have fooled two
men."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/icap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p>t was, and still is, in some parts of
Constantinople, the custom of the
refuse-gatherer to go about the
streets with a basket on his
back, and a wooden shovel in his hand,
calling out 'refuse removed.'</p>

<p>A certain Chepdji, plying his trade, had, in
the course of five years of assiduous labor,
amassed, to him, the no unimportant sum of
five hundred piasters. He was afraid to keep
this money by him; so hearing the Cadi of
Stamboul highly and reverently spoken of, he
decided to entrust his hard-earned savings to
the Cadi's keeping.</p>

<p>Going to the Cadi, he said: "Oh learned
and righteous man, for five long years have
I labored, carrying the dregs and dross of rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and poor alike, and I have saved a sum of five
hundred piasters. With the help of Allah, in
another two years I shall have saved a further
sum of at least one hundred piasters, when,
Inshallah, I shall return to my country and
clasp my wife and children again. In the
meantime you will be granting a boon to your
slave, if you will consent to keep this money
for me until the time for departure has come."</p>

<p>The Cadi replied: "Thou hast done well,
my son; the money will be kept and given to
thee when required."</p>

<p>The poor Chepdji, well satisfied, departed.
But after a very short time he learned that
several of his friends were about to return to
their Memleket (province), and he decided to
join them, thinking that his five hundred
piasters were ample for the time being, 'Besides,'
said he, 'who knows what may or may
not happen in the next two years?' So he
decided to depart with his friends at once.</p>

<p>He went to the Cadi, explained that he had
changed his mind, that he was going to leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
for his country immediately, and asked for
his money. The Cadi called him a dog and
ordered him to be whipped out of the place
by his servants. Alas! what could the poor
Chepdji do! He wept in impotent despair,
as he counted the number of years he must
yet work before beholding his loved ones.</p>

<p>One day, while moving the dirt from the
Konak of a wealthy Pasha, his soul uttered a
sigh which reached the ears of the Hanoum,
and from the window she asked him why he
sighed so deeply. He replied that he sighed
for something that could in no way interest
her. The Hanoum's sympathy was excited,
and after much persuasion, he finally, with
tears in his eyes, related to her his great
misfortune. The Hanoum thought for a few
minutes and then told him to go the following
day to the Cadi at a certain hour and
again ask for the money as if nothing had
happened.</p>

<p>The Hanoum in the meantime gathered
together a quantity of jewelry, to the value<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of several hundred pounds, and instructed her
favorite and confidential slave to come with
her to the Cadi and remain outside whilst she
went in, directing her that when she saw the
Chepdji come out and learned that he had
gotten his money, to come in the Cadi's room
hurriedly and say to her, "your husband has
arrived from Egypt, and is waiting for you at
the Konak."</p>

<p>The Hanoum then went to the Cadi, carrying
in her hand a bag containing the jewelry.
With a profound salaam she said:</p>

<p>"Oh Cadi, my husband, who is in Egypt and
who has been there for several years, has at last
asked me to come and join him there; these
jewels are of great value, and I hesitate to take
them with me on so long and dangerous a
journey. If you would kindly consent to
keep them for me until my return, or if I
never return to keep them as a token of my
esteem, I will think of you with lifelong
gratitude."</p>

<p>The Hanoum then began displaying the rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
jewelry. Just then the Chepdji entered, and
bending low, said:</p>

<p>"Oh master, your slave has come for his
savings in order to proceed to his country."</p>

<p>"Ah, welcome," said the Cadi, "so you
are going already!" and immediately ordered
the treasurer to pay the five hundred piasters
to the Chepdji.</p>

<p>"You see," said the Cadi to the Hanoum,
"what confidence the people have in me.
This money I have held for some time without
receipt or acknowledgment; but directly it is
asked for it is paid."</p>

<p>No sooner had the Chepdji gone out of the
door, than the Hanoum's slave came rushing
in, crying: "Hanoum Effendi! Hanoum
Effendi! Your husband has arrived from
Egypt, and is anxiously awaiting you at the
Konak."</p>

<p>The Hanoum, in well-feigned excitement,
gathered up her jewelry and, wishing the Cadi
a thousand years of happiness, departed.</p>

<p>The Cadi was thunderstruck, and caressing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
his beard with grave affection thoughtfully
said: "Allah! Allah! For forty years have I
been judge, but never was a cause pleaded in
this fashion before."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/hcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><p>adji was a married man, but even
Turkish married men are not invulnerable
to the charms of other
women. It happened one day, when
possibly the engrossing power of his lawful wife's
influence was feeble upon him, that a charming
Hanoum came to his shop to purchase some
spices. After the departure of his fair visitor
Hadji, do what he might, could not drive from
his mind's eye, either her image, or her attractive
power. He was further greatly puzzled
by a tiny black bag containing twelve grains
of wheat, which the Hanoum had evidently
forgotten.</p>

<p>Till a late hour that night did Hadji remain
in his shop, in the hope that either the Hanoum
or one of her servants would come for the bag,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
and thus give him the means of seeing her
again or at least of learning where she lived.
But Hadji was doomed to disappointment, and,
much preoccupied, he returned to his home.
There he sat, unresponsive to his wife's conversation,
thinking, and no doubt making mental
comparisons between her and his visitor.</p>

<p>Hadji remained downcast day after day, and
at last, giving way to his wife's entreaties to
share his troubles, he frankly told her what had
happened, and that ever since that day his soul
was in his visitor's bondage.</p>

<p>"Oh husband," replied his wife, "and do you
not understand what that black bag containing
the twelve grains of wheat means?"</p>

<p>"Alas! no," replied Hadji.</p>

<p>"Why, my husband, it is plain, plain as if it
had been told. She lives in the Wheat Market,
at house No. 12, with a black door."</p>

<p>Much excited, Hadji rushed off and found
that there was a No. 12 in the Wheat Market,
with a black door, so he promptly knocked.
The door opened, and who should he behold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
but the lady in question? She, however, instead
of speaking to him, threw a basin of water out
into the street and then shut the door. Hadji,
with mingled feelings of gratitude to his wife for
having so accurately directed him, but none the
less surprised at his reception, lingered about
the doorway for a time and then returned
home. He greeted his wife more pleasantly
than he had for many days, and told her of
his strange reception.</p>

<p>"Why," said his wife, "don't you understand
what the basin of water thrown out of the door
means?"</p>

<p>"Alas! no," said Hadji.</p>

<p>"Veyh! Veyh! (an exclamation of pity) it
means that at the back of the house there is a
running stream, and that you must go to her
that way."</p>

<p>Off rushed Hadji and found that his wife was
right; there was a running stream at the back
of the house, so he knocked at the back door.
The Hanoum, however, instead of opening it,
came to the window, showed a mirror, reversed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
it and then disappeared. Hadji lingered at
the back of the house for a long time, but
seeing no further sign of life, he returned
to his home much dejected. On entering the
house, his wife greeted him with: "Well, was
it not as I told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hadji. "You are truly a wonderful
woman, Mashallah! But I do not know
why she came to the window and showed me
a mirror both in front and back, instead of
opening the door."</p>

<p>"Oh," said his wife, "that is very simple; she
means that you must go when the face of the
moon has reversed itself, about ten o'clock."
The hour arrived, Hadji hurried off, and so
did his wife; the one to see his love, and the
other to inform the police.</p>

<p>Whilst Hadji and his charmer were talking in
the garden the police seized them and carried
them both off to prison, and Hadji's wife,
having accomplished her mission, returned
home.</p>

<p>The next morning she baked a quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
lokum cakes, and taking them to the prison,
begged entrance of the guards and permission
to distribute these cakes to the
prisoners, for the repose of the souls of her
dead. This being a request which could not
be denied, she was allowed to enter. Finding
the cell in which the lady who had infatuated
her husband was confined, she offered to save
her the disgrace of the exposure, provided
she would consent never again to look upon
Hadji, the merchant, with envious or loving
eyes. The conditions were gratefully accepted,
and Hadji's wife changed places with the
prisoner.</p>

<p>When they were brought before the judge,
Hadji was thunderstruck to see his wife, but
being a wise man he held his peace, and left
her to do the talking, which she did most
vigorously, vehemently protesting against the
insult inflicted on both her and her husband
in bringing them to prison, because they chose
to converse in a garden, being lawfully wedded
people; in witness whereof, she called upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the Bekdji (watchman) and the Imam (priest)
of the district and several of her neighbors.</p>

<p>Poor Hadji was dumfounded, and, accompanied
by his better half, left the prison, where
he had expected to stay at least a year or two,
saying: "Truly thou art a wonderful woman,
Mashallah."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/icap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p>n one of the towers overlooking
the Sea of Marmora and skirting
the ancient city of Stamboul, there
lived an old junkman, who earned
a precarious livelihood in gathering cinders
and useless pieces of iron, and selling them
to smiths.</p>

<p>Often did he moralize on the sad Kismet
that had reduced him to the task of daily
laboring for his bread to make a shoe, perhaps
for an ass. Surely he, a true Mussulman,
might at least be permitted to ride the ass.
His eternal longing often found satisfaction in
passing his hours of sleep in dreams of wealth
and luxury. But with the dawning of the day
came reality and increased longing.</p>

<p>Often did he call on the spirit of sleep to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
reverse matters, but in vain; with the rising
of the sun began the gathering of the cinders
and iron.</p>

<p>One night he dreamt that he begged this
nocturnal visitor to change his night to day,
and the spirit said to him: "Go to Egypt,
and it shall be so."</p>

<p>This encouraging phrase haunted him by
day and inspired him by night. So persecuted
was he with the thought that when his
wife said to him, from the door, "Have you
brought home any bread?" he would reply,
"No, I have not gone; I will go to-morrow;"
thinking she had asked him, "Have you gone
to Egypt?"</p>

<p>At last, when friends and neighbors began
to pity poor Ahmet, for that was his name, as
a man on whom the hand of Allah was heavily
laid, removing his intelligence, he one morning
left his house, saying: "I go! I go! to the
land of wealth!" And he left his wife wringing
her hands in despair, while the neighbors
tried to comfort her. Poor Ahmet went straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
on board a boat which he had been told was
bound for Iskender (Alexandria), and assured
the captain that he was summoned thither,
and that he was bound to take him. Half-witted
and mad persons being more holy than
others, Ahmet was conveyed to Iskender.</p>

<p>Arriving in Iskender, Hadji Ahmet roamed
far and wide, proceeding as far as Cairo, in
search of the luxuries he had enjoyed at
Constantinople when in the land of Morpheus,
which he had been promised to enjoy
in the sunshine, if he came to Egypt. Alas!
for Hadji Ahmet; the only bread he had to eat
was that which was given him by sympathizing
humanity. Time sped on, sympathy was
growing tired of expending itself on Hadji
Ahmet, and his crusts of bread were few and
far between.</p>

<p>Wearied of life and suffering, he decided to
ask Allah to let him die, and wandering out to
the Pyramids he solicited the stones to have
pity and fall on him. It happened that a
Turk heard this prayer, and said to him:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
"Why so miserable, father? Has your soul
been so strangled that you prefer its being
dashed out of your body, to its remaining the
prescribed time in bondage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my son," said Hadji Ahmet. "Far
away in Stamboul, with the help of God, I
managed as a junkman to feed my wife and
myself; but here am I, in Egypt, a stranger,
alone and starving, with possibly my wife
already dead of starvation, and all this through
a dream."</p>

<p>"Alas! Alas! my father! that you at your
age should be tempted to wander so far from
home and friends, because of a dream. Why,
were I to obey my dreams, I would at this
present moment be in Stamboul, digging for a
treasure that lies buried under a tree. I can
even now, although I have never been there,
describe where it is. In my mind's eye I see
a wall, a great wall, that must have been built
many years ago, and supporting or seeming to
support this wall are towers with many corners,
towers that are round, towers that are square,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and others that have smaller towers within
them. In one of these towers, a square one,
there live an old man and woman, and close
by the tower is a large tree, and every night
when I dream of the place, the old man tells
me to dig and disclose the treasure. But,
father, I am not such a fool as to go to Stamboul
and seek to verify this. It is an oft-repeated
dream and nothing more. See what
you have been reduced to by coming so far."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hadji Ahmet, "it is a dream
and nothing more, but you have interpreted it.
Allah be praised, you have encouraged me; I
will return to my home."</p>

<p>And Hadji Ahmet and the young stranger
parted, the one grateful that it had pleased
Allah to give him the power to revive and
encourage a drooping spirit, and the other
grateful to Allah that when he had despaired
of life a stranger should come and give him
the interpretation of his dream. He certainly
had wandered far and long to learn that the
treasure was in his own garden.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
Hadji Ahmet in due course, much to the
astonishment of both wife and neighbors,
again appeared upon the scene not a much
changed man. In fact, he was the cinder
and iron gatherer of old.</p>

<p>To all questions as to where he was and
what he had been doing, he would answer:
"A dream sent me away, and a dream brought
me back."</p>

<p>And the neighbors would say: "Truly he
must be blessed."</p>

<p>One night Hadji Ahmet went to the tree,
provided with spade and pick, that he had
secured from an obliging neighbor. After
digging a short time a heavy case was brought
to view, in which he found gold, silver, and
precious jewels of great value. Hadji Ahmet
replaced the case and earth and returned to
bed, much lamenting that it had pleased God
to furnish women, more especially his wife,
with a long tongue, long hair, and very short
wits. Alas! he thought, if I tell my wife, I
may be hung as a robber, for it is against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
laws of nature for a woman to keep a secret.
Yet, becoming more generous when thinking
of the years of toil and hardship she had
shared with him, he decided to try and see
if, by chance, his wife was not an exception
to other women. Who knows, she might
keep the secret. To test her, at no risk to
himself and the treasure, he conceived a
plan.</p>

<p>Crawling from his bed, he sallied forth and
bought, found, or stole an egg. This egg on
the following morning he showed to his wife,
and said to her:</p>

<p>"Alas! I fear I am not as other men, for
evidently in the night I laid this egg; and,
wife mine, if the neighbors hear of this, your
husband, the long-suffering Hadji Ahmet, will
be bastinadoed, bowstrung, and burned to
death. Ah, truly, my soul is strangled."</p>

<p>And without another word Hadji Ahmet,
with a sack on his shoulder, went forth to
gather the cast-off shoes of horse, ox, or ass,
wondering if his wife would prove an excep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>tion
in this, as she had in many other ways,
to other women.</p>

<p>In the evening he returned, heavily laden
with his finds, and as he neared home he heard
rumors, ominous rumors, that a certain Hadji
Ahmet, who had been considered a holy man,
had done something that was unknown in the
history of man, even in the history of hens&mdash;that
he had laid a dozen eggs.</p>

<p>Needless to add that Hadji Ahmet did not
tell his wife of the treasure, but daily went
forth with his sack to gather iron and cinders,
and invariably found, when separating his
finds of the day, in company with his wife, at
first one, and then more gold and silver pieces,
and now and then a precious stone.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_CHAPKIN_HALID_BECAME_CHIEF_DETECTIVE" id="HOW_CHAPKIN_HALID_BECAME_CHIEF_DETECTIVE"></a>HOW CHAPKIN HALID BECAME CHIEF DETECTIVE</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/icap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p>n Balata there lived, some years ago,
two scapegraces, called Chapkin
Halid and Pitch Osman. These
two young rascals lived by their
wits and at the expense of their neighbors.
But they often had to lament the ever-increasing
difficulties they encountered in procuring
the few piasters they needed daily for bread
and the tavern. They had tried several
schemes in their own neighborhood, with
exceptionally poor results, and were almost
disheartened when Chapkin Halid conceived
an idea that seemed to offer every chance of
success. He explained to his chum Osman
that Balata was "played out," at least for a
time, and that they must go elsewhere to satisfy
their needs. Halid's plan was to go to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Stamboul, and feign death in the principal
street, while Osman was to collect the funeral
expenses of his friend Halid.</p>

<p>Arriving in Stamboul, Halid stretched himself
on his back on the pavement and covered
his face with an old sack, while Osman sat
himself down beside the supposed corpse, and
every now and then bewailed the hard fate of
the stranger who had met with death on the
first day of his arrival. The corpse prompted
Osman whenever the coast was clear, and the
touching tale told by Osman soon brought
contributions for the burial of the stranger.
Osman had collected about thirty piasters, and
Halid was seriously thinking of a resurrection,
but was prevented by the passing of the Grand
Vizier, who, upon inquiring why the man lay
on the ground in that fashion, was told that he
was a stranger who had died in the street.
The Grand Vizier thereupon gave instructions
to an Imam, who happened to be at hand, to
bury the stranger and come for the money
to the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Halid was reverently carried off to the
Mosque, and Osman thought that it was time
to leave the corpse to take care of itself. The
Imam laid Halid on the marble floor and prepared
to wash him prior to interment. He
had taken off his turban and long cloak and
got ready the water, when he remembered that
he had no soap, and immediately went out to
purchase some. No sooner had the Imam disappeared
than Halid jumped up, and, donning
the Imam's turban and long cloak, repaired to
the Sublime Porte. Here he asked admittance
to the Grand Vizier, but this request was not
granted until he told the nature of his business.
Halid said he was the Imam who, in
compliance with the verbal instructions received
from his Highness, had buried a
stranger and that he had come for payment.
The Grand Vizier sent five gold pieces (twenty
piasters each) to the supposed Imam, and
Halid made off as fast as possible.</p>

<p>No sooner had Halid departed than the
cloakless Imam arrived in breathless haste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and explained that he was the Imam who had
received instructions from the Grand Vizier to
bury a stranger, but that the supposed corpse
had disappeared, and so had his cloak and
turban. Witnesses proved this man to be the
bona-fide Imam of the quarter, and the Grand
Vizier gave orders to his Chief Detective to
capture, within three days, on pain of death,
and bring to the Sublime Porte, this fearless
evil-doer.</p>

<p>The Chief Detective was soon on the track
of Halid; but the latter was on the keen lookout.
With the aid of the money he had
received from the Grand Vizier to defray
his burial expenses he successfully evaded the
clutches of the Chief Detective, who was
greatly put about at being thus frustrated.
On the second day he again got scent of
Halid and determined to follow him till an
opportunity offered for his capture. Halid
knew that he was followed and divined the
intentions of his pursuer. As he was passing
a pharmacy he noticed there several young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
men, so he entered and explained in Jewish-Spanish
(one of his accomplishments) to the
Jew druggist, as he handed him one of the gold
pieces he had received from the Grand Vizier,
that his uncle, who would come in presently,
was not right in his mind; but that if the druggist
could manage to douche his head and back
with cold water, he would be all right for a
week or two. No sooner did the Chief Detective
enter the shop than, at a word from the
apothecary, the young men seized him and, by
means of a large squirt, they did their utmost
to effectively give him the salutary and cooling
douche. The more the detective protested,
the more the apothecary consolingly explained
that the operation would soon be over and
that he would feel much better, and told of
the numerous similar cases he had cured in a
like manner. The detective saw that it was
useless to struggle, so he abandoned himself
to the treatment; and in the meantime Halid
made off. The Chief Detective was so disheartened
that he went to the Grand Vizier<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
and asked him to behead him, as death was
preferable to the annoyance he had received
and might still receive at the hands of Chapkin
Halid. The Grand Vizier was both furious
and amused, so he spared the Chief Detective
and gave orders that guards be placed
at the twenty-four gates of the city, and that
Halid be seized at the first opportunity.
A reward was further promised to the person
who would bring him to the Sublime
Porte.</p>

<p>Halid was finally caught one night as he was
going out of the Top-Kapou (Cannon Gate),
and the guards, rejoicing in their capture,
after considerable consultation decided to
bind Halid to a large tree close to the Guard
house, and thus both avoid the loss of sleep
and the anxiety incident to watching over so
desperate a character. This was done, and
Halid now thought that his case was hopeless.
Towards dawn, Halid perceived a man with a
lantern walking toward the Armenian Church,
and rightly concluded that it was the beadle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
going to make ready for the early morning
service. So he called out in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Beadle! Brother! Beadle! Brother! come
here quickly."</p>

<p>Now it happened that the beadle was a
poor hunchback, and no sooner did Halid
perceive this than he said:</p>

<p>"Quick! Quick! Beadle, look at my back
and see if it has gone!"</p>

<p>"See if what has gone?" asked the beadle,
carefully looking behind the tree.</p>

<p>"Why, my hump, of course," answered
Halid.</p>

<p>The beadle made a close inspection and
declared that he could see no hump.</p>

<p>"A thousand thanks!" fervently exclaimed
Halid, "then please undo the rope."</p>

<p>The beadle set about to liberate Halid, and
at the same time earnestly begged to be told
how he had got rid of the hump, so that he
also might free himself of his deformity.
Halid agreed to tell him the cure, provided
the beadle had not yet broken fast, and also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
that he was prepared to pay a certain small
sum of money for the secret. The beadle
satisfied Halid on both of these points, and
the latter immediately set about binding the
hunchback to the tree, and further told him,
on pain of breaking the spell, to repeat sixty-one
times the words: 'Esserti! Pesserti! Sersepeti!'
if he did this, the hump would of
a certainty disappear. Halid left the poor
beadle religiously and earnestly repeating the
words.</p>

<p>The guards were furious when they found,
bound to the tree, a madman, as they thought,
repeating incoherent words, instead of Halid.
They began to unbind the captive, but the
only answer they could get to their host of
questions was 'Esserti, Pesserti, Sersepeti.'
As the knots were loosened, the louder did the
beadle in despair call out the charmed words
in the hopes of arresting them. No sooner
was the beadle freed than he asked God to
bring down calamity on the destroyers of the
charm that was to remove his hunch. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
hearing the beadle's tale, the guards understood
how their prisoner had secured his
liberty, and sent word to the Chief Detective.
This gentleman told the Grand Vizier of the
unheard-of cunning of the escaped prisoner.
The Grand Vizier was amused and also very
anxious to see this Chapkin Halid, so he sent
criers all over the city, giving full pardon to
Halid on condition that he would come to the
Sublime Porte and confess in person to the
Grand Vizier. Halid obeyed the summons,
and came to kiss the hem of the Grand
Vizier's garment, who was so favorably impressed
by him that he then and there appointed
him to be his Chief Detective.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/ecap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="E" title="E" />
</div><p>very day cobbler Ahmet, year in
and year out, measured the
breadth of his tiny cabin with his
arms as he stitched old shoes.
To do this was his Kismet, his decreed fate,
and he was content&mdash;and why not? his business
brought him quite sufficient to provide
the necessaries of life for both himself and
his wife. And had it not been for a coincidence
that occurred, in all probability he
would have mended old boots and shoes to
the end of his days.</p>

<p>One day cobbler Ahmet's wife went to the
Hamam (bath), and while there she was much
annoyed at being obliged to give up her compartment,
owing to the arrival of the Harem
and retinue of the Chief Astrologer to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Sultan. Much hurt, she returned home and
vented her pique upon her innocent husband.</p>

<p>"Why are you not the Chief Astrologer to
the Sultan?" she said. "I will never call or
think of you as my husband until you have
been appointed Chief Astrologer to his
Majesty."</p>

<p>Ahmet thought that this was another phase
in the eccentricity of woman which in all probability
would disappear before morning, so he
took small notice of what his wife said. But
Ahmet was wrong. His wife persisted so much
in his giving up his present means of earning
a livelihood and becoming an astrologer, that
finally, for the sake of peace, he complied
with her desire. He sold his tools and collection
of sundry old boots and shoes, and,
with the proceeds purchased an inkwell and
reeds. But this, alas! did not constitute him
an astrologer, and he explained to his wife
that this mad idea of hers would bring him
to an unhappy end. She, however, could not
be moved, and insisted on his going to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
highway, there to wisely practise the art, and
thus ultimately become the Chief Astrologer.</p>

<p>In obedience to his wife's instructions,
Ahmet sat down on the highroad, and his
oppressed spirit sought comfort in looking at
the heavens and sighing deeply. While in
this condition a Hanoum in great excitement
came and asked him if he communicated
with the stars. Poor Ahmet sighed, saying
that he was compelled to converse with
them.</p>

<p>"Then please tell me where my diamond
ring is, and I will both bless and handsomely
reward you."</p>

<p>The Hanoum, with this, immediately
squatted on the ground, and began to tell
Ahmet that she had gone to the bath that
morning and that she was positive that she
then had the ring, but every corner of the
Hamam had been searched, and the ring was
not to be found.</p>

<p>"Oh! astrologer, for the love of Allah, exert
your eye to see the unseen."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
"Hanoum Effendi," replied Ahmet, the instant
her excited flow of language had ceased,
"I perceive a rent," referring to a tear he
had noticed in her shalvars or baggy trousers.
Up jumped the Hanoum, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"A thousand holy thanks! You are right!
Now I remember! I put the ring in a crevice
of the cold water fountain." And in her
gratitude she handed Ahmet several gold
pieces.</p>

<p>In the evening he returned to his home,
and giving the gold to his wife, said: "Take
this money, wife; may it satisfy you, and in
return all I ask is that you allow me to go
back to the trade of my father, and not expose
me to the danger and suffering of trudging
the road shoeless."</p>

<p>But her purpose was unmoved. Until he
became the Chief Astrologer she would
neither call him nor think of him as her
husband.</p>

<p>In the meantime, owing to the discovery
of the ring, the fame of Ahmet the cobbler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
spread far and wide. The tongue of the
Hanoum never ceased to sound his praise.</p>

<p>It happened that the wife of a certain
Pasha had appropriated a valuable diamond
necklace, and as a last resource, the Pasha
determined, seeing that all the astrologers,
Hodjas, and diviners had failed to discover
the article, to consult Ahmet the cobbler,
whose praises were in every mouth.</p>

<p>The Pasha went to Ahmet, and, in fear and
trembling, the wife who had appropriated the
necklace sent her confidential slave to overhear
what the astrologer would say. The
Pasha told Ahmet all he knew about the necklace,
but this gave no clue, and in despair he
asked how many diamonds the necklace contained.
On being told that there were twenty-four,
Ahmet, to put off the evil hour, said it
would take an hour to discover each diamond,
consequently would the Pasha come on the
morrow at the same hour when, Inshallah, he
would perhaps be able to give him some news.</p>

<p>The Pasha departed, and no sooner was he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
out of earshot, than the troubled Ahmet exclaimed
in a loud voice:</p>

<p>"Oh woman! Oh woman! what evil influence
impelled you to go the wrong path, and drag
others with you! When the twenty-four hours
are up, you will perhaps repent! Alas! Too
late. Your husband gone from you forever!
Without a hope even of being united in
paradise."</p>

<p>Ahmet was referring to himself and his
wife, for he fully expected to be cast into
prison on the following day as an impostor.
But the slave who had been listening gave another
interpretation to his words, and hurrying
off, told her mistress that the astrologer knew
all about the theft. The good man had even
bewailed the separation that would inevitably
take place. The Pasha's wife was distracted,
and hurried off to plead her cause in person
with the astrologer. On approaching Ahmet,
the first words she said, in her excitement,
were:</p>

<p>"Oh learned Hodja, you are a great and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
good man. Have compassion on my weakness
and do not expose me to the wrath of
my husband! I will do such penance as you
may order, and bless you five times daily as
long as I live."</p>

<p>"How can I save you?" innocently asked
Ahmet. "What is decreed is decreed!"</p>

<p>And then, though silent, looked volumes,
for he instinctively knew that words unuttered
were arrows still in the quiver.</p>

<p>"If you won't pity me," continued the Hanoum,
in despair, "I will go and confess
to my Pasha, and perhaps he will forgive
me."</p>

<p>To this appeal Ahmet said he must ask the
stars for their views on the subject. The
Hanoum inquired if the answer would come
before the twenty-four hours were up. Ahmet's
reply to this was a long and concentrated
gaze at the heavens.</p>

<p>"Oh Hodja Effendi, I must go now, or the
Pasha will miss me. Shall I give you the
necklace to restore to the Pasha without ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>planation,
when he comes to-morrow for the
answer?"</p>

<p>Ahmet now realized what all the trouble
was about, and in consideration of a fee, he
promised not to reveal her theft on the condition
that she would at once return home and
place the necklace between the mattresses of
her Pasha's bed. This the grateful woman
agreed to do, and departed invoking blessings
on Ahmet, who in return promised to exercise
his influence in her behalf for astral intervention.</p>

<p>When the Pasha came to the astrologer at
the appointed time, he explained to him, that
if he wanted both the necklace and the thief
or thieves, it would take a long time, as it was
impossible to hurry the stars; but if he would
be content with the necklace alone, the
horoscope indicated that the stars would
oblige him at once. The Pasha said that he
would be quite satisfied if he could get his
diamonds again, and Ahmet at once told him
where to find them. The Pasha returned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
his home not a little sceptical, and immediately
searched for the necklace where Ahmet
had told him it was to be found. His joy
and astonishment on discovering the long-lost
article knew no bounds, and the fame of
Ahmet the cobbler was the theme of every
tongue.</p>

<p>Having received handsome payment from
both the Pasha and the Hanoum, Ahmet earnestly
begged of his wife to desist and not
bring down sorrow and calamity upon his
head. But his pleadings were in vain. Satan
had closed his wife's ear to reason with envy.
Resigned to his fate, all he could do was to
consult the stars, and after mature thought
give their communication, or assert that the
stars had, for some reason best known to the
applicant, refused to commune on the subject.</p>

<p>It happened that forty cases of gold were
stolen from the Imperial Treasury, and every
astrologer having failed to get even a clue as
to where the money was or how it had disappeared,
Ahmet was approached. Poor man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
his case now looked hopeless! Even the
Chief Astrologer was in disgrace. What
might be his punishment he did not know&mdash;most
probably death. Ahmet had no idea of
the numerical importance of forty; but concluding
that it must be large he asked for a
delay of forty days to discover the forty cases
of gold. Ahmet gathered up the implements
of his occult art, and before returning to his
home, went to a shop and asked for forty
beans&mdash;neither one more nor one less.
When he got home and laid them down
before him he appreciated the number of
cases of gold that had been stolen, and
also the number of days he had to live.
He knew it would be useless to explain to
his wife the seriousness of the case, so that
evening he took from his pocket the forty
beans and mournfully said:</p>

<p>"Forty cases of gold,&mdash;forty thieves,&mdash;forty
days; and here is one of them," handing
a bean to his wife. "The rest remain in their
place until the time comes to give them up."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
While Ahmet was saying this to his wife
one of the thieves was listening at the window.
The thief was sure he had been discovered
when he heard Ahmet say, "And here is
one of them," and hurried off to tell his
companions.</p>

<p>The thieves were greatly distressed, but decided
to wait till the next evening and see what
would happen then, and another of the number
was sent to listen and see if the report
would be verified. The listener had not long
been stationed at his post when he heard
Ahmet say to his wife: "And here is another
of them," meaning another of the forty days
of his life. But the thief understood the
words otherwise, and hurried off to tell his
chief that the astrologer knew all about it and
knew that he had been there. The thieves
consequently decided to send a delegation to
Ahmet, confessing their guilt and offering to
return the forty cases of gold intact. Ahmet
received them, and on hearing their confession,
accompanied with their condition to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
return the gold, boldly told them that he did
not require their aid; that it was in his
power to take possession of the forty cases of
gold whenever he wished, but that he had no
special desire to see them all executed, and he
would plead their cause if they would go and
put the gold in a place he indicated. This
was agreed to, and Ahmet continued to give
his wife a bean daily&mdash;but now with another
purpose; he no longer feared the loss of his
head, but discounted by degrees the great
reward he hoped to receive. At last the final
bean was given to his wife, and Ahmet was
summoned to the Palace. He went, and explained
to his Majesty that the stars refused
both to reveal the thieves and the gold, but
whichever of the two his Majesty wished
would be immediately granted. The Treasury
being low, it was decided that, provided the
cases were returned with the gold intact, his
Majesty would be satisfied. Ahmet conducted
them to the place where the gold was buried,
and amidst great rejoicing it was taken back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
to the Palace. The Sultan was so pleased
with Ahmet, that he appointed him to the
office of Chief Astrologer, and his wife attained
her desire.</p>

<p>The Sultan was one day walking in his Palace
grounds accompanied by his Chief Astrologer;
wishing to test his powers he caught a
grasshopper, and holding his closed hand out
to the astrologer asked him what it contained.
Ahmet, in a pained and reproachful tone,
answered the Sultan by a much-quoted
proverb: "Alas! Your Majesty! the grasshopper
never knows where its third leap will
land it," figuratively alluding to himself
and the dangerous hazard of guessing what
was in the clenched hand of his Majesty.
The Sultan was so struck by the reply that
Ahmet was never again troubled to demonstrate
his powers.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/acap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p> servant of his Majesty Sultan
Ahmet, who had been employed
for twenty-five years in the Palace,
begged leave of the Sultan to allow
him to retire to his native home, and at the
same time solicited a pension to enable him
to live. The Sultan asked him if he had not
saved any money. The man replied that owing
to his having to support a large family, he had
been unable to do so. The Sultan was very
angry that any of his servants, especially in the
immediate employ of his household, should,
after so many years' service, say that he was
penniless. Disbelieving the statement, and in
order to make an example, the Sultan gave
orders that Hassan should quit the Palace in
the identical state he had entered it twenty-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>five
years before. Hassan was accordingly
disrobed of all his splendor, and his various
effects, the accumulation of a quarter of a
century, were confiscated, and distributed
amongst the legion of Palace servants. Poor
Hassan, without a piaster in his pocket, and
dressed in the rude costume of his native province,
began his weary journey homeward on
foot.</p>

<p>In time he reached the suburbs of a town in
Asia Minor, and seeing some boys playing, he
approached them, sat on the ground, and
watched their pastime. The boys were playing
at state affairs: one was a Sultan, another his
Vizier, who had his cabinet of Ministers, while
close by were a number of boys bound hand
and foot, representing political and other prisoners,
awaiting judgment for their imaginary
misdeeds. The Sultan, who was sitting with
worthy dignity on a throne made of branches
and stones, decorated with many-colored centrepieces,
beckoned to Hassan to draw near,
and asked him where he had come from. Has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>san
replied that he had come from Stamboul,
from the Palace of the Sultan.</p>

<p>"That's a lie," said the mock Sultan, "no
one ever came from Stamboul dressed in that
fashion, much less from the Palace; you are
from the far interior, and if you do not confess
that what I say is true, you will be tried
by my Ministers, and punished accordingly."</p>

<p>Hassan, partly to participate in their boyish
amusement, and partly to unburden his aching
heart, related his sad fate to his youthful audience.
When he had finished, the boy Sultan,
Ali by name, asked him if he had received his
twenty-five years. Hassan, not fully grasping
what the boy said, replied:</p>

<p>"Nothing! Nothing!"</p>

<p>"That is unjust," continued Ali, "and you
shall go back to the Sultan and ask that your
twenty-five years be returned to you so that you
may plough and till your ground, and thus
make provision for the period of want, old
age."</p>

<p>Hassan was struck by the sound advice the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
boy had given him, thanked him and said he
would follow it to the letter. The boys then
in thoughtless mirth separated, to return to
their homes, never dreaming that the seeds of
destiny of one of their number had been
sown in play. Hassan, retracing his steps, reappeared
in time at the gates of the Palace
and begged admittance, stating that he had
forgotten to communicate something of importance
to his Majesty. His request being
granted, he humbly solicited, that, inasmuch
as his Majesty had been dissatisfied with his
long service, the twenty-five years he had
devoted to him should be returned, so that
he might labor and put by something to provide
for the inevitable day when he could no
longer work. The Sultan answered:</p>

<p>"That is well said and just. As it is not
in my power to give you the twenty-five
years, the best equivalent I can grant you is
the means of sustenance for a period of that
duration should you live so long. But tell me,
who advised you to make this request?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
Hassan then related his adventure with the
boys while on his journey home, and his
Majesty was so pleased with the judgment and
advice of the lad that he sent for him and had
him educated. The boy studied medicine,
and distinguishing himself in the profession
ultimately rose to be Hekim Ali Pasha.</p>

<p>He had one son who was known as Doctor
Ali Pasha's son. He studied calligraphy, and
became so proficient in this art, now almost
lost, that his imitations of the Imperial Irad&eacute;s
(decrees) were perfect fac-similes of the originals.
One day he took it into his head to
write an Irad&eacute; appointing himself Grand
Vizier, in place of the reigning one, a prot&eacute;g&eacute;
of the Imperial Palace, which Irad&eacute; he took
to the Sublime Porte and there and then installed
himself. By chance the Sultan happened
to drive through Stamboul that day, in
disguise, and noticing considerable excitement
and cries of "Padishahim chok yasha"
(long live my Sultan) amongst the people,
made inquiries as to the cause of this unusual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
occurrence. His Majesty's informers brought
him the word that the people rejoiced in the
fall of the old Grand Vizier, and the appointment
of the new one, Doctor Ali Pasha's son.
The Sultan returned to the Palace and immediately
sent one of his eunuchs to the Sublime
Porte to see the Grand Vizier and find out
the meaning of these strange proceedings.</p>

<p>The eunuch was announced, and the Grand
Vizier ordered him to be brought into his
presence. Directly he appeared in the doorway,
he was greeted with: "What do you want,
you black dog?"</p>

<p>Then turning to the numerous attendants
about, he said: "Take this nigger to the slave
market, and see what price he will bring."</p>

<p>The eunuch was taken to the slave market,
and the highest price bid for him was fifty
piasters. On hearing this, the Grand Vizier
turned to the eunuch and said: "Go and tell
your master what you are worth, and tell him
that I think it too much by far."</p>

<p>The eunuch was glad to get off, and com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>municated
to his Majesty the story of his strange
treatment. The Sultan then ordered his Chief
Eunuch, a not unimportant personage in the
Ottoman Empire, to call on the Grand Vizier
for an explanation. At the Sublime Porte,
however, no respect was paid to this high dignitary.
Ali Pasha received him in precisely
the same manner as he had received his subordinate.
The chief was taken to the slave
market, and the highest sum bid for him was
five hundred piasters. The self-appointed
Grand Vizier ordered him to go and tell his
master the amount some foolish people were
willing to pay for him.</p>

<p>When the Sultan heard of these strange proceedings
he sent an autograph letter to Ali
Pasha, commanding him to come to the Palace.
The Grand Vizier immediately set out for the
Palace and was received in audience, when he
explained to his Majesty that the affairs of
State could not be managed by men not worth
more than from fifty to five hundred piasters,
and that if radical changes were not made,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
certain ruin would be the outcome. The Sultan
appreciated this earnest communication,
and ratified the appointment, as Grand Vizier,
of Ali Pasha, the son of the boy who had
played at state affairs in a village of Asia
Minor.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MERCIFUL_KHAN" id="THE_MERCIFUL_KHAN"></a>THE MERCIFUL KHAN</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/tcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p>here lived once near Ispahan a
tailor, a hard-working man, who
was very poor. So poor was he
that his workshop and house together
consisted of a wooden cottage of but
one room.</p>

<p>But poverty is no protection against thieves,
and so it happened that one night a thief
entered the hut of the tailor. The tailor had
driven nails in various places in the walls on
which to hang the garments that were
brought to him to mend. It chanced that in
groping about for plunder, the thief struck
against one of these nails and put out his eye.</p>

<p>The next morning the thief appeared before
the Khan (Judge) and demanded justice.
The Khan accordingly sent for the tailor,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
stated the complaint of the thief, and said
that in accordance with the law, 'an eye for
an eye,' it would be necessary to put out one
of the tailor's eyes. As usual, however, the
tailor was allowed to plead in his own defence,
whereupon he thus addressed the court:</p>

<p>"Oh great and mighty Khan, it is true that
the law says <i>an</i> eye for an eye, but it does not
say <i>my</i> eye. Now I am a poor man, and a
tailor. If the Khan puts out one of my eyes,
I will not be able to carry on my trade, and
so I shall starve. Now it happens that there
lives near me a gunsmith. He uses but one
eye with which he squints along the barrel of
his guns. Take his other eye, oh Khan, and
let the law be satisfied."</p>

<p>The Khan was favorably impressed with this
idea, and accordingly sent for the gunsmith.
He recited to the gunsmith the complaint of
the thief and the statement of the tailor,
whereupon the gunsmith said:</p>

<p>"Oh great and mighty Khan, this tailor
knows not whereof he talks.  I need both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of my eyes; for while it is true that I squint
one eye along one side of the barrel of the
gun, to see if it is straight, I must use the
other eye for the other side. If, therefore,
you put out one of my eyes you will take
away from me the means of livelihood. It
happens, however, that there lives not far
from me a flute-player. Now I have noticed
that whenever he plays the flute he closes both
of his eyes. Take out one of his eyes, oh
Khan, and let the law be satisfied."</p>

<p>Accordingly, the Khan sent for the flute-player,
and after reciting to him the complaint
of the thief, and the words of the gunsmith,
he ordered him to play upon his flute. This
the flute-player did, and though he endeavored
to control himself, he did not succeed, but,
as the result of long habit, closed both of his
eyes. When the Khan saw this, he ordered
that one of the flute-player's eyes be put out,
which being done, the Khan spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Oh flute-player, I saw that when playing
upon your flute you closed both of your eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
It was thus clear to me that neither was necessary
for your livelihood, and I had intended
to have them both put out, but I have decided
to put out only one in order that you may tell
among men how merciful are the Khans."</p>

<h2><a name="KING_KARA-KUSH_OF_BITHYNIA" id="KING_KARA-KUSH_OF_BITHYNIA"></a>KING KARA-KUSH OF BITHYNIA</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/acap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p> King of Bithynia, named Kara-kush,
who was blind of an eye,
was considered in his day a
reasonable, just, and feeling man.
He administered justice upon the basis of
the law, 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
tooth,' and enlarged or modified it as circumstances
demanded.</p>

<p>It happened that a weaver by accident put
out the eye of a man. He was brought before
the King or Cadi, for in those days the Kings
acted as Cadis, who promptly condemned him,
in accordance with the law, to the loss of an
eye. The weaver pleaded touchingly, saying:</p>

<p>"Oh Cadi! I have a wife and a large family,
and I support them by throwing the shuttle
from the right to the left, and again from the
left to the right; first using the one eye and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
then the other. If you remove one of my eyes,
I will not be able to weave, and my wife and
children will suffer the pangs of hunger. Why
not, in the place of my eye, remove that of the
hunter who uses but one eye in exercising his
profession, and to whom two eyes are superfluous?"</p>

<p>The Cadi was impressed, acknowledged the
justice of the weaver's remarks, and the hunter
was immediately sent for. The hunter
being brought, the Cadi was greatly rejoiced to
notice that the hunter's eyes were exactly the
same color as his own. He asked the hunter
how he earned his living, and receiving his
answer that he was a hunter, the Cadi asked
him how he shot. The hunter in reply
demonstrated the manner by putting up his
arms, his head to a side, and closing one eye.
The Cadi said the weaver was right, and immediately
sent for the surgeon to have the eye
removed. Further, the Cadi bethought him
that he might profit by this and have the hunter's
eye placed in his own socket. The sur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>geon
set to work and prepared the cavity to
receive the hunter's eye. This done with a
practised hand, the surgeon removed the hunter's
eye and was about to place it in the prepared
socket, when it accidentally slipped from
his fingers to the ground, and was snatched up
by a cat. The surgeon was terrified and madly
ran after the cat; but alas! the cat had eaten
the eye. What was he to do? On the inspiration
of the moment he snatched out the
eye of the cat, and placing it in the Cadi's
head, bound it up.</p>

<p>Some time after the surgeon asked the Cadi
how he saw.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied the Cadi, "with my old eye
I see as usual, but strange to say, the new eye
you placed in my head is continually searching
and watching for rat holes."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/acap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p> poor Hamal (porter) brought to
the Pasha of Stamboul his savings,
consisting of a small canvas bag
of medjidies (Turkish silver dollars),
to be kept for him, while he was absent
on a visit to his home. The Pasha, being a
kind-hearted man, consented, and after sealing
the bag, called his steward, instructing him to
keep it till the owner called for it. The
steward gave the man a receipt, to the effect
that he had received a sealed bag containing
money.</p>

<p>When the poor man returned, he went to the
Pasha and received his bag of money. On
reaching his room he opened the bag, and to
his horror found that it contained, instead of
the medjidies he had put in it, copper piasters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
which are about the same size as medjidies.
The poor Hamal was miserable, his hard-earned
savings gone.</p>

<p>He at last gathered courage to go and put his
case before the Pasha. He took the bag of
piasters, and with trembling voice and faltering
heart he assured the Pasha that though he
had received his bag apparently intact, on
opening it he found that it contained copper
piasters and not the medjidies he had put in
it. The Pasha took the bag, examined it
closely, and after some time noticed a part
that had apparently been darned by a master-hand.
The Pasha told the Hamal to go away
and come back in a week; in the meantime
he would see what he could do for him. The
grateful man departed, uttering prayers for the
life and prosperity of his Excellency.</p>

<p>The next morning after the Pasha had said
his prayers kneeling on a most magnificent and
expensive rug, he took a knife and cut a long
rent in it. He then left his Konak without
saying a word to any one. In the evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
when he returned he found that the rent had
been so well repaired that it was with difficulty
that he discovered where it had been.
Calling his steward, he demanded who had
repaired his prayer rug. The steward told the
Pasha that he thought the rug had been cut
by accident by some of the servants, so he
had sent to the Bazaar for the darner, Mustapha,
and had it mended, the steward, by
way of apology, adding that it was very well
done.</p>

<p>"Send for Mustapha immediately," said the
Pasha, "and when he comes bring him to
my room."</p>

<p>When Mustapha arrived, the Pasha asked
him if he had repaired the rug. Mustapha at
once replied that he had mended it that very
morning.</p>

<p>"It is indeed well done," said the Pasha;
"much better than the darn you made in that
canvas bag."</p>

<p>Mustapha agreed, saying that it was very
difficult to mend the bag as it was full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
copper piasters. On hearing this, the Pasha
gave him a backsheesh (present) and told him
to retire. The Pasha then called his steward,
and not only compelled him to pay the Hamal
his money, but discharged him from his service,
in which he had been engaged for many
years.</p>

</div><p> Turk decided to have a feast, so
he killed and stuffed a goose
and took it to the baker to be
roasted. The Cadi of the village
happened to pass by the oven as the baker
was basting the goose, and was attracted by
the pleasant and appetizing odor. Approaching
the baker, the Cadi said it was a fine
goose; that the smell of it made him quite
hungry, and suggested that he had better send
it to his house. The baker expostulated, saying:
"I cannot; it does not belong to me."</p>

<p>The Cadi assured him that was no difficulty.
"You tell Ahmet, the owner of the goose, that
it flew away."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said the baker. "How can
a roasted goose fly away? Ahmet will only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
laugh at me, your Worship, and I will be cast
into prison."</p>

<p>"Am I not a Judge?" said the Cadi, "fear
nothing."</p>

<p>At this the baker consented to send the goose
to the Cadi's house. When Ahmet came for
his goose the baker said: "Friend, thy goose
has flown."</p>

<p>"Flown?" said Ahmet, "what lies! Am
I thy grandfather's grandchild that thou
shouldst laugh in my beard?"</p>

<p>Seizing one of the baker's large shovels, he
lifted it to strike him, but, as fate would have
it, the handle put out the eye of the baker's
boy, and Ahmet, frightened at what he had
done, ran off, closely followed by the baker
and his boy, the latter crying: "My eye!"</p>

<p>In his hurry Ahmet knocked over a child,
killing it, and the father of the child joined
in the chase, calling out: "My daughter!"</p>

<p>Ahmet, well-nigh distracted, rushed into a
mosque and up a minaret. To escape his
pursuers he leaped from the parapet, and fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
upon a vender who was passing by, breaking
his arm. The vender also began pursuing
him, calling out: "My arm!"</p>

<p>Ahmet was finally caught and brought before
the Cadi, who no doubt was feeling contented
with the world, having just enjoyed the delicious
goose.</p>

<p>The Cadi heard each of the cases brought
against Ahmet, who in turn told his case
truthfully as it had happened.</p>

<p>"A complicated matter," said the Cadi.
"All these misfortunes come from the flight
of the goose, and I must refer to the book of
the law to give just judgment."</p>

<p>Taking down a ponderous manuscript volume,
the Cadi turned to Ahmet and asked him
what number egg the goose had been hatched
from. Ahmet said he did not know.</p>

<p>"Then," replied the Cadi, "the book writes
that such a phenomenon was possible. If
this goose was hatched from the seventh egg,
and the hatcher also from the seventh egg,
the book writes that it is possible for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
roasted goose, under those conditions, to fly
away."</p>

<p>"With reference to your eye," continued
the Cadi, addressing the baker's lad, "the
book provides punishment for the removal of
two eyes, but not of one, so if you will consent
to your other eye being taken out, I will condemn
Ahmet to have both of his removed."</p>

<p>The baker's lad, not appreciating the force
of this argument, withdrew his claim.</p>

<p>Then turning to the father of the dead
child, the Cadi explained that the only provision
for a case like this in the book of the
law, was that he take Ahmet's child in its
place, or if Ahmet had not a child, to wait till
he got one. The bereaved parent not taking
any interest in Ahmet's present or prospective
children, also withdrew his case.</p>

<p>These cases settled, there remained but the
vender's, who was wroth at having his arm
broken. The Cadi expatiated on the justice
of the law and its far-seeing provisions, that
the vender at least could claim ample com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>pensation
for having his arm broken. The
book of the law provided that he should go to
the very same minaret, and that Ahmet must
station himself at the very same place where
he had stood when his arm was broken; and
that he might jump down and break Ahmet's
arm.</p>

<p>"But be it understood," concluded the
Cadi, "if you break his leg instead of his
arm, Ahmet will have the right to delegate
some one to jump down on you to break your
leg."</p>

<p>The vender not seeing the force of the
Cadi's proposal, also withdrew his claim.</p>

<p>Thus ended the cases of the goose, the eye,
the daughter, and the arm.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/ocap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="O" title="O" />
</div><p>n a day amongst the many days,
when the Turk was more earnest
than now, before the Europeans
came and gave new ideas to our
children, there lived and labored for the welfare
of our people an organized body of men.
At whose suggestion this society was formed I
know not. All that we know of them to-day,
through our fathers, is that their forefathers
chose from among them the most wise, sincere,
and experienced forty brethren. These
forty were named the Forty Wise Men. When
one of the forty was called away from his
labors here, perhaps to continue them in
higher spheres, or to receive his reward, who
knows? the remaining thirty-nine consulted
and chose from the community him whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
they thought capable, and worthy of guiding
and of being guided, to add to their number.
They lived and held their meetings in a
mosque of which little remains now, the
destructive hand of time having left it but a
battered dome, with cheerless walls and great
square holes, where once were iron bars and
stained glass. It has gone&mdash;so have the wise
men. But its foundations are solid, and they
may in time come to support an edifice dedicated
to noble work, and, Inshallah, the seed
of the Forty Wise Men will also bear fruit in
the days that are not yet.</p>

<p>You will say, what good did this body of
men do? These men who always numbered
forty were, as I have told you, originally
chosen by the people, and when one of the
forty departed from his labors here, the remaining
thirty-nine consulted together and
from the most worthy of the community they
chose another member.</p>

<p>What was the good of this body of men?
Great, great, my friends. Not only did they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
administer justice to the oppressed, and give
to the needy substantial aid; but their very
existence had the most beneficial effect on
the community. Why? you ask. Because
each vied with the other to be worthy of
being nominated for the vacancy when it occurred.
No station in life was too low to be
admitted, no station was too high for one of
the faithful to become one of the 'Forty.'
Here all were equal. As Allah himself doth
consider mankind by deeds, so also mankind
was considered by the Forty Wise Men, who
presided over the welfare and smoothed the
destiny of the children of Allah. With their
years, their wisdom grew, and they were
blessed by Allah.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>In the town of Scutari, over the way, there
lived and labored a Dervish. His counsel
to the rash was ever ready, his sole object,
apparently, in life was to become one of the
Forty Wise Men, who presided over the people
and protected them from all ills.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
The years went on, and still without a reward
he patiently labored, no doubt contenting
himself with the idea that the day
would come when the merit of his actions
would be recognized by Allah. That was a
mistake, my friends; true faith expecteth
nothing. However, the day did come, and
the Dervish's great desire had every appearance
of being realized. One of the Forty Wise
Men having accomplished his mission on earth,
departed this life. The remaining thirty-nine,
who still had duties to fulfil, consulted as
to whom they should call to aid them in
their work. A eulogy was pronounced in
favor of the Dervish. They not unjustly considered
how he had labored among the poor
in Scutari; ever ready to help the needy, ever
ready to counsel the rash, ever ready to comfort
and encourage the despairing. It was decided
that he should be nominated. A deputation
consisting of three, two to listen, one to speak,
was named, and with the blessing of their
brethren, for success, they entered a caique<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
and were rowed to Scutari. Arriving at the
Dervish's gate, the spokesman thus addressed
the would-be member of the Forty Wise Men:</p>

<p>"Brother in the flesh, thy actions have been
noted, and we come to put a proposition to
thee, which, after consideration, thou wilt
either accept or reject as thou thinkest best
for all interested therein. We would ask
thee to become one of us. We are sent
hither by, and are the representatives of,
the sages who preside over the people.
Brother, we number in all one hundred and
thirty-eight in spirit;&mdash;ninety-nine, having
accomplished their task in the flesh, have departed;
thirty-nine, still in the flesh, endeavor
their duty to fulfil. And it is the desire of
the one hundred and thirty-eight souls to add
to us thyself, in order to complete our number
of laborers in the flesh. Brother, thy
duties, which will be everlasting, thou wilt
learn when with us. Do thou consider, and
we will return at the setting of the sun of
the third day, to receive thy answer."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
And they turned to depart. But the Dervish
stopped them, saying: "Brothers, I have
no need to consider the subject for three days,
seeing that my inmost desire for thirty years,
and my sole object in life has been to become
worthy of being one of you. In spirit I have
long been your brother, in the flesh it is easy
to comply, seeing that it has been the spirit's
desire."</p>

<p>Then answered the spokesman: "Brother,
thou hast spoken well. Allah, thou art with us
in our choice; we praise Thee. Brother, one
word! Our ways are different to all men's ways;
thou hast but to have faith, and all is well."</p>

<p>"Brethren, faith! I have had faith; my
faith is now even strengthened. I do your
bidding."</p>

<p>"Brother, first of all thy worldly goods must
be disposed of and rendered into gold. Every
earthly possession thou hast must be represented
by a piece of gold. Therefore see to
that; we have other duties to fulfil, but will
return ere the sun sets in the west."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
The Dervish set about selling all his goods;
and when the coloring of the sky in the west
harbingered the closing of the day, he had disposed
of everything and stood waiting with
naught but a sack of gold.</p>

<p>The three wise men returned, and, on seeing
the Dervish, said: "Brother, thou hast done
well; we will hence."</p>

<p>A caique was in waiting, and the four entered.
Silently the caique glided over the
smooth surface of the Bosphorus; and silently
the occupants sat. When beyond Maidens'
Tower, the spokesman, turning to the Dervish,
said: "Brother, with thy inmost blessing
give me that sack, representing everything
thou dost possess in this world."</p>

<p>The Dervish handed the sack as he was
bidden, and the wise man solemnly rose, and
holding it on high, said: "With the blessing
of our brother Mustapha," and dropped it
where the current is strongest. Then, sitting
down, resumed his silence. The deed was
done, and nothing outward told the story; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Caiquedji dipped his oars, and the waves
rippled as soft as before. Nothing but the
distant, soothing cry of the Muezzin, calling
the faithful to prayer, now waxing, now
waning, now completely dying away as they
moved around the minarets, broke the stillness.</p>

<p>Ere long the boat was brought to the
shore, the four men wended their way up the
steep hill, and the horizon, wrapped in the
mantle of night, hid them from the boatman's
sight. A few minutes' walk brought them to
the mosque of the Forty Wise Men; the
spokesman turned to the Dervish, and said:
"Brother, faithfully follow," and then passed
through the doorway. They entered a large,
vaulted chamber, the ceiling of which was
artistically inlaid with mosa&iuml;ques, and the
floor covered with tiles of the ceramic art of
bygone ages. From the centre hung a large
chandelier holding a number of little oil cups,
each shedding its tiny light, as if to show
that union was strength. Round this chandelier
were seven brass filagreed, hemispherical-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>shaped
lanterns, holding several oil burners.
These many tiny burners gave a soothing,
contented, though undefined light, which,
together with the silence, added to the impressiveness
of the place. Round this hall
were forty boxes of the same shape and
size.</p>

<p>Our friend stood in the centre of the hall
and under the influence of the scene, he was
afraid to breathe; he did not know whether to
be happy or sad, for having come so far.</p>

<p>As he stood thus thinking, dreaming, one
of the curtains was raised, and there came
forth a very old man, his venerable white
beard all but touching his girdle.</p>

<p>Solemnly and slowly he walked over to the
opposite side, and following in his train
came thirty-eight more, the last apparently
being the youngest.</p>

<p>Chill after chill went coursing down the
spinal cord of the astonished would-be brother,
whilst these men moved about in the unbroken
silence, as if talking to invisible beings; now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
embracing, now clasping hands, now bidding
farewell.</p>

<p>The Dervish closed his eyes, opened them,
Were these things so? Yes, it was no dream,
no hallucination. Yet why heard he no sound?</p>

<p>Each of the brethren now took his place
beside a box, but there was one vacancy; no
one stood at the side of the box to the left
of the youngest brother. Making a profound
salaam, which all answered, the old man silently
turned, raised the curtain, and passed
into the darkness, each in his order following.
As one in a trance, the Dervish watched one
after another disappear. The last now raised
the curtain, but before vanishing, turned (it
was the spokesman), and whispered: "Brother,
faith, follow!" and stepped into the darkness.</p>

<p>These words acted upon the Dervish like a
spell; he followed.</p>

<p>Up, up, the winding stairway of a minaret
they go. At last they arrive, and to the
horror of the Dervish, what does he see?
One, two, three, disappear over the parapet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
and his friend the spokesman, with: "Brother,
faith, follow!" also vanished into the inky
darkness.</p>

<p>Again at the eleventh hour did the cheering
words of the brother spokesman act upon the
Dervish like magic, he raised his foot to the
parapet, and, in faltering decision, jumped
up two or three times. But man's guardian
does not lead him over the rugged paths of
life; he gives the impulse and you must go.
So it was with the Dervish. He jumped once,
twice, thrice, but each time fell backward
instead of forward. My friends, he hesitated
again; at the eleventh hour he was encouraged,
but undecided&mdash;he was not equal to the test.
So, with a great weight on his heart, he descended
the winding stairs of the minaret.
He had reached his zenith only in desire, and
was now on his decline.</p>

<p>Lamenting, like a weak mortal that he was,
for not having followed, he again entered the
hall he had just left, with the intention, no
doubt, of departing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
But the charm of the place was on him
again, and as he stood the curtain moved, and
the old man advanced; and as before, the
silence was unbroken. Again did each take
his place beside a box, again did the old man
salaam, with the simultaneous response of the
others. Again did they gesture as if talking
to invisible beings of some calamity which had
befallen them which they all regretted.</p>

<p>The old man went and opened the box that
stood alone. From this he took, what? the
identical bag of gold that had been dropped
into the Bosphorus some hours ago. The
spokesman came forward and took it from
the hand of the old man. The Dervish now
no longer believed that <i>he</i> was <i>he</i> himself, and
that these things were taking place. He understood
not, he knew not.</p>

<p>Coming forward, the spokesman thus addressed
the spell-bound Dervish, his voice
giving a strange echo, as if his words were
emphasized by a hundred invisible mouths:</p>

<p>"Friend and brother in the flesh, but weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
of the spirit, thou hast proved thyself unworthy
to impart that which thou hast not
thyself,&mdash;Faith! Thine actions hitherto, of
seeming conviction, have not been for the
eye of the Almighty, the All-seeing, the All-powerful
alone, but for the approbation of
mankind. To get this approbation thou hast
soared out of thine element; the atmosphere
is too rarified, thou canst not live, thou must
return!</p>

<p>"Get thee back into the world, back to thy
brothers; thou canst not be one of us. One
hundred and thirty-nine in the spirit have
regretfully judged thee as lacking in faith,
and not having a sheltered apartment within
thyself, thou canst not shelter others. No
man can bequeath that which he hath not.
Go thy way, and in secret build thee a wall,
brick by brick, action by action; let none
see thy place but the eye that seeth all,
lest a side, when all but completed, fall, and
thou art again exposed to the four winds.
Take thy money, thine all, and when hesita<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>tion
interrupts, offer a prayer in thy heart, and
then faithfully follow! Farewell!"</p>

<p>And the Dervish was led out into the street,
a lone and solitary man; he had his all in his
hand&mdash;a bag of gold.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/acap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="A" title="A" />
</div><p> Turk travelling in Asia Minor
came to a Christian village. He
journeyed on horseback, was accompanied
by a black slave, and
seeming a man of consequence, the priest of
the village offered him hospitality for the
night. The first thing to be done was to conduct
the traveller to the stable, that he might see
his horse attended to and comfortably stalled
for the night. In the stable was a magnificent
Arab horse, belonging to the priest, and the
Turk gazed upon it with covetous eyes, but
nevertheless, in order that no ill should befall
the beautiful creature and to counteract the
influence of the evil eye with certainty, he
spat at the animal. After they had dined, the
priest took his guest for a walk in the garden,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and in the course of a very pleasant conversation
he informed the Turk that on the morrow
there would be snow on the ground.</p>

<p>"Never! Impossible!" said the Turk.</p>

<p>"Well, to-morrow you will see that I am
right," said the priest.</p>

<p>"I am willing to stake my horse against
yours, that you are wrong," answered the Turk,
who was delighted at this opportunity which
gave him a chance of securing the horse, without
committing the breach in Oriental etiquette
of asking his host if he would sell it.
After some persuasion the priest accepted his
wager, and they separated for the night.</p>

<p>Later on that night, the Turk said to his
slave: "Go, Sali, go and see what the weather
says, for truly my life is in want of our good
host's horse."</p>

<p>Sali went out to make an observation, and
on returning said to his master: "Master, the
heavens are like unto your face,&mdash;without a
frown and many kindly sparkling eyes, and the
earth is like unto that of your black slave."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
"'Tis well, Sali, 'tis well. What a beautiful
animal that is!"</p>

<p>Later on, before retiring to rest, he sent his
slave on another inspection, and was gratified
to receive the same answer. Early in the
morning he awoke, and calling his slave, who
had slept at his door, he sent him forth again
to see if any change had taken place.</p>

<p>"Oh master!" reported Sali, in trembling
tones, "Nature has reversed herself, for the
heavens are now like the scowling face of your
slave, and the earth is like yours, white, entirely
white."</p>

<p>"Chok shai! wonderful thing. Then I
have lost not only that beautiful animal but
my own horse as well. Oh pity! Oh
pity!"</p>

<p>He gave up his horse, but before parting he
begged the priest to tell him how he knew it
would snow.</p>

<p>"My pig told me as we were walking in the
garden yesterday. I saw it put its nose in the
heap of manure you see in that corner, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
knew that to be a sure sign that it would snow
on the morrow," replied the priest.</p>

<p>Deeply mystified, the Turk and his slave
proceeded on foot. Reaching a Turkish village
before nightfall, he sought and obtained
shelter for the night from the Imam, the
Mohammedan priest of the village. While
partaking of the evening meal he asked the
Imam when the feast of the Bairam would be.</p>

<p>"Truly, I do not know! When the cannons
fire, I will know it is Bairam," said his host.</p>

<p>"What!" said the traveller, becoming angry,
"you an Imam,&mdash;a learned Hodja,&mdash;and
don't know when it will be Bairam, and the
pig of the Greek priest knew when it would
snow? Shame! Shame!"</p>

<p>And becoming much angered, he declined
the hospitality of the Imam and went elsewhere.</p>

<h2><a name="WHO_WAS_THE_THIRTEENTH_SON" id="WHO_WAS_THE_THIRTEENTH_SON"></a>WHO WAS THE THIRTEENTH SON</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/icap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p>n the town of Adrianople there
lived an Armenian Patriarch,
Munadi Hagop by name, respected
and loved alike by Mussulman
and Christian. He was a man of
wide reading and profound judgment. The
Ottoman Governor of the same place, Usref
Pasha, happened also to be a man of considerable
acquirements and education. The
Armenian and the Turk associated much
together. In fact, they were always either
walking out together or visiting, one at the
residence of the other. This went on for
some time, and the twelve wise men who
were judges in the city thought that their
Governor was doing wrong in associating so
much with a dog of a Christian; so they resolved
to call him to account.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
This resolution taken, the entire twelve
proceeded to the house of the Governor and
told him that he was setting a bad example
to his subjects. They feared, too, that the
salvation of his own soul and of his posterity
was in danger, should this Armenian in any
way influence his mind.</p>

<p>"My friends," answered the Governor, "this
man is very learned, and the only reason why
we so often come together is because a great
sympathy exists between us, and much mutual
pleasure is derived from this friendship. I
ask his advice, and he gives me a clear explanation.
He is my friend, and I would gladly
see him your friend."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the spokesman of the judges,
"it is his wise answers that act as magic upon
you? We will give him a question to answer,
and if he solves this to our satisfaction, he
will then in reality be a great man."</p>

<p>"I am sure you will not be disappointed!"
said the Pasha. "He has never failed me,
and I have sometimes put questions to him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
which appeared unanswerable. He will surely
call to-morrow. Shall I send him to you or
bring him myself?"</p>

<p>"We wish to see him alone," said the
judges.</p>

<p>"I shall not fail to send him to you to-morrow,
after which I am sure you will often
seek his company."</p>

<p>On the following day the Pasha told the
Patriarch how matters stood, and begged him
to call on the gentlemen who took so lively
an interest in their friendly association.</p>

<p>The Patriarch, never dreaming of what
would happen, called on the twelve wise men
and introduced himself. They were holding
the Divan, and the entrance of the Patriarch
gave considerable pleasure to them. On the
table lay a turban and a drawn sword.</p>

<p>The customary salutations having been duly
exchanged, the Patriarch seated himself, and
at once told them that his friend the Governor
had asked him to call, and he took
much pleasure in making their acquaintance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
adding that he would be happy to do anything
in his power that they might wish.</p>

<p>The spokesman of the Divan rose and said:
"Effendi, our friend the Governor has told us
of your great learning, and we have decided to
put a question to you. The reason of our
taking this liberty is because the Governor
told us that he had never put a question to
you which had remained unanswered."</p>

<p>And as he spoke he moved toward the table.</p>

<p>"Effendi, our question will consist of only
a few words." And laying his right hand on
the turban and his left hand on the sword, he
said: "Is this the right, or is this the right?"</p>

<p>The Patriarch paused aghast at the terrible
feature of the interrogation. He saw destruction
staring him in the face. Nevertheless
he said to them with great composure: "Gentlemen,
you have put an exceedingly difficult
question to me, the most difficult that could
be put to man. However, it is a question
put, and now, according to your laws, cannot
be recalled."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
"No," answered the twelve wise men, rubbing
their hands, "it cannot be recalled."</p>

<p>"I will but say that it grieves me much to
have to reply to this," the Patriarch continued,
"and I cannot do so without continued
prayers for guidance. Therefore I beg to
request a week's time before giving my
answer."</p>

<p>To this no objection was made, and the
Patriarch prepared to go. Respectfully bowing
to all present, as if nothing out of the
common had happened, he slowly moved
toward the door apparently in deep thought.</p>

<p>Just as he reached the door he turned back
and addressing the judges, said:</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, one of the reasons I had great
pleasure in meeting you to-day was because I
wished to have your advice on a difficult legal
problem which has been presented to me by
some members of my community. Knowing
your great wisdom, I thought you might assist
me, and as you are now sitting in lawful
council I shall, if agreeable to you, put the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
case before you and be greatly pleased to
learn your opinion."</p>

<p>The judges, whose curiosity was aroused,
and who were flattered that a man of such
reputation for wisdom should submit a matter
to them for their opinion, signified to him to
proceed.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen and wise men," began the Patriarch,
"there was once a father, and this
father had thirteen sons, who were esteemed
by all who knew them. As time with sure
hand marked its progress on the issue of this
good man, and the children grew into youth,
they one by one went into the world, spreading
to the four known quarters of the globe, and
carrying with them the good influence given
by their father. Through them the name of
the father spread, causing a great moral and
mental revolution throughout the world. The
father in his native home, however, saw that
his days were few, that he had well-nigh
turned the leaves of the book of life, and
yearned to see his sons once more. He ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>cordingly
sent messengers all over the world,
saying: 'Come, my sons, and receive your
father's blessing; he is about to depart this
life, come and get each one your portion of
the worldly possessions I have, together with
my blessing, and again go forth, doing each
your duty to God and man.'</p>

<p>"One by one the sons of the aged father
came, and once more were united in the
ancient home of their childhood, with the
exception of one son. The remaining days
of the old man were spent with his twelve
sons, and the brothers found that all of them
had retained the teachings of infancy, and
the pleasure was great. The reuniting of the
family, though of comparatively short duration,
was happier by far than the years of
childhood and youth which they had spent
together. Still the thirteenth son was not
found. The messengers returned one after
the other, bearing no tidings of him. The
old father saw that he could wait no longer,
that he must dispose of his worldly posses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>sions,
give his blessing to his twelve sons
and rejoin his Father. So he called them
to his side and thus spoke to them:</p>

<p>"'My sons, as you have done may it be
done unto you. You have cheered my last
steps to the grave, and I bless you.'</p>

<p>"And the father's blessing was bestowed on
each.</p>

<p>"'Of all I possess I give to each of you an
equal share with my blessing. You are my
offspring and the representatives of your
father on earth. It is my will that you
should continue as you have begun. You
are my twelve sons, and I have no other.
Your brother who was, is no longer. We
have waited long, that he should take his
portion and my blessing; but he has tarried
elsewhere, and now the hand of my Father is
on me, and as you have come to me, so I
must go to show Him my work.'</p>

<p>"So the father ordained that the twelve
should be his heirs, and declared that any one
coming after claiming to be his son, was an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
impostor. He also confirmed in the existing
and competent courts that these alone were
his representatives on earth. This was duly
registered in conformity with the law, and
the old father passed away to rejoin his forefathers.</p>

<p>"The twelve sons again went forth into the
world and carried with them the blessings and
teachings of their father, and these teachings
and ideas developed and grew, and the memory
of their father was cherished and blessed.</p>

<p>"Many years after, a person turned up
claiming to be the missing son, and sought
to obtain the part due to him. Not only did
he wish his share, but he claimed the whole
worldly possessions of his father, that he was
the son blessed by his father, and exhorted
all to follow his teachings. By those who
knew the circumstances, he was not believed;
but many were ignorant of the father, and
also ignorant of the registering in the courts
of law, and were inclined to believe in the
impostor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
"Now, gentlemen, this is the case that has
troubled me much. As you are sitting in
lawful council, it would give me much pleasure
if you could cast light on the case. Your
statement will help me, and I will be ever
grateful to you. Had this son, the late returned
person, any right to all the worldly
possessions of the father, or, in fact, even any
right to an equal share?"</p>

<p>Thus having spoken he turned to the Hodjas
with an inquiring look. They one and all,
unanimously, and in a breath said, that all
the legal formalities having been carried out,
the will of the father was law, and the law
he passed should be respected, therefore the
thirteenth son was an impostor. On returning
he should have gone to his brothers, and
no doubt he would have been received as a
brother, but he acted otherwise. He should
receive nothing.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see that you look at it in
that light, and I will now say that that has
always been my opinion, but your statement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
now adds strength to the conviction, and had
there been any doubt on my part, your unanimous
declaration would have dispelled it. I
would further esteem it a great kindness and
a favor if, as a reference and as a proof of
my authority, or rather as a corroboration of
many proofs, you would, as you are sitting in
lawful Divan, give your signatures to the effect
that the decision of the learned council was
unanimous, and to this said effect, that the
thirteenth son was an impostor, and had no
right to any of the possessions he claimed."</p>

<p>Flattered that their opinion had such
weight, the judges also consented to do this,
and the Patriarch set about drawing up the
case. This he read to them, and each put
his hand and seal to the document.</p>

<p>The Patriarch thanked them and departed.</p>

<p>A week had passed, and the judges had entirely
forgotten the case that had been put to
them, but they had not forgotten the Patriarch,
and eagerly awaited his answer to their
question which left no alternative, and which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
would cause his head to be separated from his
body by a blow of the executioner. But
the Patriarch did not make his appearance,
and as the prescribed time had passed, the
judges went to the Governor to see what steps
should be taken.</p>

<p>The Governor was deeply grieved when the
judges told him of the terrible question they
had put to the Patriarch, yet remembering
leaving that morning the Patriarch who had
been with him, and who seemed in no wise
anxious, he said that he was convinced that
either a satisfactory answer had been given or
would be forthcoming. He questioned the
Hodjas as to what had taken place, and they
answered that nothing had been said beyond
the question that had been put to him and
his request for a week's time in which to
answer.</p>

<p>"Did he say nothing at all," asked the
Pasha, "before he left?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the spokesman of the
judges, "except that he put to us a case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
which he had been called on to decide and
asked our opinion."</p>

<p>"What was this case?" asked the Pasha.
And the judges recited it to him, told what
opinion they had given, and stated that they
had, at the Patriarch's request and for his use,
placed their seal to this opinion.</p>

<p>"Go home, you heads of asses," said the
Governor, "and thank Allah that it is to a
noble and a great man who would make no
unworthy use of it that you have delivered a
document testifying that Mohammed is an
impostor. In future, venture not to enter into
judgment with men whom it has pleased God
to give more wit than to yourselves."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/tcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p>he chief Imam of the Vilayet
of Broussa owed to a Jew money-lender
the sum of two hundred
piasters. The Jew wanted his
money and would give no rest to the Imam.
Daily he came to ask for it, but without success.
The Jew was becoming very anxious
and determined to make a great effort. Not
being able to take the Imam to court, he decided
to try and shame him into paying
the sum due; and to effect this, he came,
sat on his debtor's doorstep and bewailed his
sad fate in having fallen into the hands of a
tyrant. The Imam saw that if this continued,
his reputation as a man of justice would be
considerably impaired, so he thought of a plan
by which to pay off his creditor. Calling the
Jew into his house, he said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
"Friend, what wilt thou do with the money
if I pay thee?"</p>

<p>"Get food, clothe my children, and advance
in my business," answered the Jew.</p>

<p>"My friend," said the Imam, "thy pitiful
position awakens my compassion. Thou art
gathering wealth in this world at the cost of
thy soul and peace in the world to come; and
I wish I could help thee. I will tell thee what
I will do for thee. I would not do the same
thing for any other Jew in the world, but thou
hast awakened my commiseration. For the
debt I owe thee, I will sell thee two hundred
yards of Paradise, and being owner of this
incomparable possession in the world to come,
thou canst fearlessly go forth and earn as much
as possible in this world, having already made
ample provision for the next."</p>

<p>What could the Jew do but take what the
Imam was willing to give him? So he accepted
the deed for the two hundred yards of
Paradise. A happy thought now struck the
Jew. He set off and found the tithe-collector<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
of the revenues of the mosque, and made
friends with him. He then explained to him,
when the intimacy had developed, how he was
the possessor of a deed entitling him to two
hundred yards of Paradise, and offered the
collector a handsome commission if he would
help him in disposing of it. When the money
had been gathered for the quarter, the collector
came and discounted the Imam's document,
returning it to him as two hundred
piasters of the tithes collected, with the statement
that this document had been given to
him by a peasant, and that bearing his holy
seal, he dared not refuse it.</p>

<p>The Imam was completely deceived, and
thought that the Jew had sold the deed at a
discount to some of his subjects who were in
arrears, and of course had to receive it as
being as good as gold. Nevertheless the Jew
was not forgotten, and the Imam determined
to have him taken into court and sentenced if
possible. His charge against the Jew was that
he, the chief priest of the province, had taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
pity on this Jew, thinking what a terrible thing
it was to know no future, and as the man
hitherto had an irreproachable character, in
consideration of a small debt he had against
the church, which it was desirable to balance,
he thought he would give this Jew two hundred
yards of Paradise, which he did.</p>

<p>"Now, gentlemen, this ungrateful dog sold
this valuable document, and it was brought
back to me as payment of taxes in arrears due
to the church. Therefore, I say that this Jew
has committed a great sin and ought to be
punished accordingly."</p>

<p>The Cadis now turned to hear the Jew, who,
the personification of meekness, stood as if
awaiting his death sentence. With the most
innocent look possible, the Jew replied, when
the Cadis asked him what he had to say for
himself:</p>

<p>"Effendim, it is needless to say how I appreciate
the kindness of our Imam, but the
reason that I disposed of that valuable document
was this: When I went to Paradise I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
found a seat, and measured out my two hundred
yards, and took possession of the further
inside end of the bench. I had not been
there long when a Turk came and sat beside
me. I showed him my document and protested
against his taking part of my seat; but,
gentlemen, I assure you it was altogether useless;
the Turks came and came, one after the
other, till, to make a long story short, I fell
off at the other end of the seat, and here I
am. The Turks in Paradise will take no heed
of your document, and either will not recognize
the authority of the Imam, or will not let
the Jews enter therein.</p>

<p>"Effendim, what could I do but come
back and sell the document to men who could
enter Paradise, and this I did."</p>

<p>The Cadis, after consulting, gave judgment
as follows:</p>

<p>"We note that you could not have done anything
else but sell the two hundred yards of
Paradise, and the fact that you cannot enter
there is ample punishment for the wrong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
committed; but there is still a grievous
charge against you, which, if you can clear to
our satisfaction, you will at once be dismissed.
How much did the document cost
you and what did you sell it for?"</p>

<p>"Effendim, it cost me two hundred piasters,
and I sold it for two hundred piasters."</p>

<p>This statement having been proved by producing
the deed in question, and the tithe-collector
who had given it to the Imam for
two hundred piasters, the Jew was acquitted.</p>

</div><p>irkedji, the landing-place on the
Stamboul side of the Golden Horn,
is always a scene of bustle and
noise. The Caiquedjis, striving
for custom, cry at the top of their voices:
"I am bound for Haskeuy; I can take another
man; my fare is a piaster!"</p>

<p>Others call in lusty tones, that they are bound
for Karakeuy. Further out in the stream are
other caiques, bound for more distant places,
some with a passenger or two, others without.
In one of these sat a Jew patiently waiting,
while the Caiquedji, standing erect, backed
in and out, every now and then calling at the
top of his voice: 'Iuskidar,' meaning that he
was bound for Scutari, on the Asiatic shore.</p>

<p>At last a Mussulman signed to him to ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>proach,
and inquired his fare. After some
bargaining, the Turk entered the caique, and
the boatman still held on to the pier in the
hope of securing a third passenger, which,
after a very short time, he did. The third
passenger happened to be a Jew, who had forsaken
his faith for that of Islam.</p>

<p>This converted individual saw at a glance
that one of his fellow-passengers was a Moslem
and the other a Jew, and wishing to gain
favor in the eyes of the former, he called the
other a 'Yahoudi' (meaning Jew, but usually
employed as a term of disdain) and told him
to make room for him. This the Jew meekly
did, without a murmur, and the Caiquedji
bent his oars for the Asiatic shore. The converted
Jew and the Turk started a conversation,
which they kept up till within a short distance
of Scutari, when the Turk turned and said to
the Jew, who had humbly been sitting on the
low seat with bowed head and closed eyes:</p>

<p>"And what have you to say on the subject,
Moses?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
"Alas! Pasha Effendi," answered the Jew,
"I have been asleep, and have not followed
your conversation; and if I had, what worth
could my opinion be, I, a poor Jew?"</p>

<p>The converted Jew then said: "At least, you
can tell us, to pass the time, where you have
been in your sleep?" and he burst out laughing,
thinking it a capital joke.</p>

<p>"I dreamt I was in Paradise," replied the
poor Jew. "Oh! it was wonderful! There
were three great golden gates, and on the
inside, at the side of the keeper of each gate,
stood Mohammed at one, Moses at the other,
and Jesus at the third. No one was allowed
to pass into Paradise, unless Mohammed,
Moses, or Jesus gave the order that they
should pass. At Mohammed's gate a man
knocked, and on being opened, the keeper
asked:</p>

<p>"'What is your name?' to which he replied,
'Ahmet.'</p>

<p>"'And your father's name?' again asked
the keeper. 'Abdullah.'</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
"And the prophet signed with his hand that
he might enter.</p>

<p>"I then went to the gate where Jesus stood,
and heard the same questions put to an applicant.
He told the keeper that his name was
Aristide, and that his father's name was Vassili,
and Jesus permitted him to enter.</p>

<p>"Hearing a loud knocking at Mohammed's
gate again, I hurried to see who the important
comer was. There stood a man of confident
mien, who proudly answered that his name was
Hussein Effendi.</p>

<p>"'And your father's name?' asked the
keeper. 'Abraham,' replied Hussein. At
this Mohammed said: 'Shut the door; you
can't enter here; mixtures will not do.'"</p>

<p>"Eh! What happened next?" asked the Turk.</p>

<p>"Just then, as the gate was shutting, I heard
your voice and I awoke, Pasha Effendi,"
answered the Jew; "and so I can't tell you."</p>

<p>And as they approached the Scala (landing),
they disembarked at Scutari and separated
without a word.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/hcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="H" title="H" />
</div><p>ussein Agha was much troubled
in spirit and mind. He had
saved a large sum of money in
order that he might make the
pilgrimage to Mecca. What troubled him
was, that after having carefully provided for
all the expenses of this long journey there
still remained a few hundred piasters over and
above. What was he to do with these? True,
they could be distributed amongst the poor,
but then, might not he, on his return, require
the money for even a more meritorious
purpose?</p>

<p>After much consideration, he decided that
it was not Allah's wish that he should at once
give this money in charity. On the other
hand, he felt convinced that he should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
give it to a brother for safe keeping, as he
might be inspired, during Hussein's pilgrimage,
to spend it on some charitable purpose.
After a time he thought of a kindly Jew who
was his neighbor, and decided to leave his
savings in the hands of this man, to whom
Allah had been good, seeing that his possessions
were great. After mature thought he
decided not to put temptation in the way of
his neighbor. He therefore secured a jar, at
the bottom of which he placed a small bag
containing his surplus of wealth, and filled
it with olives. This he carried to his neighbor,
and begged him to take care of it for him.
Ben Mo&iuml;se of course consented, and Hussein
Agha departed on his pilgrimage, contented.</p>

<p>On his return from the Holy Land, Hussein,
now a Hadji, repaired to Ben Mo&iuml;se and
asked for his jar of olives, and at the same
time presented Ben Mo&iuml;se with a rosary of
Yemen stones, in recognition of the service
rendered him in the safe keeping of the
olives, which, he said, were exceptionally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
palatable. Ben Mo&iuml;se thanked him, and
Hadji Hussein departed with his jar, well
satisfied.</p>

<p>During the absence of Hussein Agha, it
happened that Ben Mo&iuml;se had some distinguished
visitors, to whom, as is the Eastern
custom, he served raki. Unfortunately, however,
he had no m&eacute;z&eacute; (appetizer) to offer, as
is also the custom in the East. Ben Mo&iuml;se
bethought him of the olives and immediately
went to the cellar, opened the jar, and extracted
some of them, saying: "Olives are not
rare; Hussein will never know the difference
if I replace them."</p>

<p>The olives were found excellent, and Ben
Mo&iuml;se again and again helped his friends to
them. Great was his surprise when he found
that instead of olives, he brought forth a bag
containing a quantity of gold. Ben Mo&iuml;se
could not understand this phenomenon, but
appropriated the gold and held his peace.</p>

<p>Arriving home, poor Hussein Agha was distracted
to find that his jar contained nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
but olives. Vainly did he protest to Ben
Mo&iuml;se.</p>

<p>"My friend," he would reply, "you gave me
the jar, saying it contained olives. I believed
you and kept the jar safe for you. Now you
say that in the jar you had put some money
together with the olives; perhaps you did, but
is not that the jar you gave me? If, as you
say, there was gold in the jar and it is now
gone, all I can say is, the stronger has overcome
the weaker, and that in this case the gold has
either been converted into olives or into oil.
What can I do? The jar you gave me I returned
to you."</p>

<p>Hadji Hussein admitted this, and fully
appreciated that he had no case against the
Jew, so saying: 'Chok shai!' he returned to
his home.</p>

<p>That night Hussein mingled in his prayers a
vow to recover his gold at no matter what cost
or trouble.</p>

<p>In his younger days Hadji Hussein had
been a pipe-maker, and many were the chi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>books
of exceptional beauty that he had made.
Go but to the potters' lane at Tophane, and
the works of art displayed by the majority of
them have been fashioned by the hands of
Hussein. The art that had fed him for years
was now to be the means of recovering his
money.</p>

<p>Hadji Hussein daily met Ben Mo&iuml;se but he
never again referred to the money, and further,
Hussein's sons were always in company
with Ben Mo&iuml;se's only son, a lad of ten.</p>

<p>Time passed, and Ben Mo&iuml;se entirely forgot
about the jar, olives, and gold; not so Hadji
Hussein. He had been working. First he
had made an effigy of Ben Mo&iuml;se. When he
had completed this image to his satisfaction,
he dressed it in the identical manner and
costume the Jew habitually wore. He then
purchased a monkey. This monkey was kept
in a cage opposite the effigy of Ben Mo&iuml;se.
Twice a day regularly the monkey's food was
placed on the shoulders of the Jew, and Hussein
would open the cage, saying: "Babai git"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
(go to your father). At a bound the monkey
would plant himself on the shoulders of the
Jew, and would not be dislodged until its
hunger had been satisfied.</p>

<p>In the meantime Hadji Hussein and Ben
Mo&iuml;se were greater friends than ever, and
their children were likewise playmates. One
day Hussein took Ben Mo&iuml;se's son to his
Harem and told him, much to the lad's joy,
that he was to be their guest for a week.
Later on Ben Mo&iuml;se called on Hadji Hussein
to know the reason of his son's not returning
as usual at sundown.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend," said Hussein, "a great
calamity has befallen you! Your son, alas!
has been converted into a monkey, a furious
monkey! So furious that I was compelled to
put him into a cage. Come and see for
yourself."</p>

<p>No sooner did Ben Mo&iuml;se enter the room in
which the caged monkey was, than it set up
a howl, not having had any food that day.
Poor Ben Mo&iuml;se was thunderstruck, and Hadji<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
Hussein begged him to take the monkey
away.</p>

<p>Next day Hussein was summoned to the
court, the case of Ben Mo&iuml;se was heard, and
the Hadji was ordered to return the child at
once. This he vowed he could not do, and
to convince the judges he offered to bring the
monkey caged as it was to the court, and,
Inshallah, they would see for themselves that
the child of the Jew had been converted into
a monkey. This was ultimately agreed to,
and the monkey was brought. Hadji Hussein
took special care to place the cage opposite
Ben Mo&iuml;se, and no sooner did the monkey
catch sight of him than it set up a scream,
and the judges said: 'Chok shai!' Hussein
Agha then opened the cage door, saying: "Go
to your father," and the monkey with a bound
and a yell embraced Ben Mo&iuml;se, putting his
head, in search of food, first on one shoulder
of the Jew and then on the other. The judges
were thunderstruck, and declared their incompetency
to give judgment in such a case. Ben<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
Mo&iuml;se protested, saying that it was against the
laws of nature for such a metamorphosis to
take place, whereupon Hadji Hussein told the
judges of an analogous instance of some gold
pieces turning into olives, and called upon
Ben Mo&iuml;se to witness the veracity of his statement.
The judges, much perplexed, dismissed
the case, declaring that provision had not been
made in the law for it, and there being no
precedent to their knowledge they were incompetent
to give judgment.</p>

<p>Leaving the court, Hadji Hussein informed
Ben Mo&iuml;se that there would still be pleasure
and happiness in this world for him, provided
he could reconvert the olives into gold.
Needless to add that Ben Mo&iuml;se handed the
money to Hadji Hussein, and the heir of Ben
Mo&iuml;se returned to his home none the worse
for his transformation.</p>

Califs after the Prophet, is deeply
venerated to this day, and is continually
quoted as a lover of truth
and justice. Often in the face of appalling
evidence he refrained from judgment, thus
liberating the innocent and punishing the
guilty. The following is given as an example
of his perseverance in fathoming a murder.</p>

<p>At the feast of the Passover, a certain Jew
of Bagdad had sacrificed his sheep and was
offering up his prayers, when suddenly a dog
came in, and snatching up the sheep's head
ran off with it. The Jew pursued in hot haste,
in his excitement still carrying the bloody
knife and wearing his besmeared apron. The
dog, carrying the sheep's head, rushed into an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
open doorway, followed closely by the Jew.
The Jew in his hurried pursuit fell over the
body of what proved to be a murdered man.
The murder was laid against the Jew, and
witnesses swore that they had seen him coming
out of the house covered with blood, and in
his hand a bloody dagger. The Jew was arrested
and tried, but with covered head he
swore by his forefathers and children that he
was innocent. Omar would not condemn
him as none of the witnesses had seen the
Jew do the deed, and until further evidence
had been given to prove his guilt the case
was adjourned. Spies and detectives, unknown
to anybody, were put to track the
murderers. After a time they were discovered,
condemned, put to death, and the Jew
liberated.</p>

</div><p>alata, situated on the Golden
Horn, is mostly inhabited by
Jews of the poorer classes, who
make their livelihood as tinsmiths,
tinkers, and hawkers.</p>

<p>Here, in the early days when the Janissaries
flourished, there lived a certain tinsmith
called Kalaidji Avram. Having rather an
extensive business, his neighbors, especially
those who lived nearest, were always complaining
of the annoying smoke and disagreeable
odor of ammonia which he used in tinning
his pots and pans.</p>

<p>Opposite Avram's place the village guard-house
was situated, and the chief, a Janissary,
often had disputes with Avram about the
smoke. Avram would invariably reply: "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
have my children to feed and I must work;
and without smoke I cannot earn their daily
bread."</p>

<p>The Janissary, much annoyed, cultivated a
dislike for Avram and a thirst for revenge.</p>

<p>It happened that a Jew one day came to the
Janissary and said to him: "Do you want to
make a fortune? if so, you have the means of
doing this, provided you will agree to halve
with me whatever is made."</p>

<p>The Janissary, on being assured that he had
but to say a word or two to a person he would
designate and the money would be forthcoming,
accepted the conditions. The Jew then
said: "All you have to do is to go up to a
Jewish funeral procession that will pass by
here to-morrow on its way to the necropolis
outside the city, and order it to stop. It is
against the religion of the Jews for such a
thing to happen, and the Chacham (rabbi)
will offer you first ten, then twenty, and finally
one hundred and ten thousand piasters to
allow the funeral to proceed. The half will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
for you to compensate you for your trouble and
the other fifty-five thousand piasters for me."</p>

<p>This, as the Jew had told him, seemed very
simple to the Janissary. The next day, true
enough, he beheld a funeral, and immediately
went out and ordered it to stop. The Chacham
protested, offering first small bribes,
then larger and larger, till ultimately he
promised to bring to the worthy captain one
hundred and ten thousand piasters for allowing
the funeral to proceed.</p>

<p>That evening, as agreed, the Chacham came
and handed the money to the captain of the
Janissaries. Then taking another bag containing
a second one hundred and ten thousand
piasters, he said: "If you will tell me
who informed you that we would pay so much
money rather than have a funeral stopped,
you can have this further sum."</p>

<p>The Janissary immediately bethought him of
Avram, the tinsmith, and accused him as his
informant, and the Chacham, satisfied, paid
the sum and departed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Avram disappeared nobody knew where.
The Chacham said that death had taken him
for his own as a punishment for stopping him
while on a journey.</p>

<p>The accomplice of the Janissary came a few
days later for his share of the money. The
Janissary handed him the fifty-five thousand
piasters, and at the same time said: "Of
these fifty-five thousand piasters, thirty thousand
must be given to the widow and children
of Avram, and I advise you to give it willingly,
for Avram has taken your place."</p>

</div><p> Jewish merchant was in the habit
of borrowing, and sometimes of
lending money to an Armenian
merchant of Cairo. Receipts were
never exchanged, but at the closing of an old
account or the opening of a new one they would
simply say to each other, I have debited or
credited you in my books, as the case might
be, with so much.</p>

<p>On one occasion the Armenian lent the Jew
the sum of twenty-five thousand piasters, and
after the usual verbal acknowledgment the
Armenian made his entry. A reasonable time
having elapsed, the Armenian sent his greetings
to the Jew. This, in Eastern etiquette,
meant, 'Kindly pay me what you owe.' The
Jew, however, did not take the hint but re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>turned
complimentary greetings to the Armenian.
This was repeated several times.
Finally, the Armenian sent a message requesting
the Jew to call upon him. The Jew,
however, told the messenger to inform the
Armenian merchant, that if he wished to see
him, he must come to his house. The Armenian
called upon the Jew, and requested
payment of the loan. The Jew brought out
his books and showed the Armenian that he
was both credited and debited with the sum
of twenty-five thousand piasters. The Armenian
protested, but in vain; the Jew maintained
that the debt had been paid.</p>

<p>In the hope of recovering his money, the
Armenian had the case brought before Mehmet
Ali Pasha of Egypt, a clever and learned
judge. No witnesses, however, could be cited
to prove that the money had either been borrowed
or repaid. The entries were verified,
and it was thought that perhaps the Armenian
had forgotten. Before dismissing the case,
however, Mehmet Ali Pasha called in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Public Weigher and ordered that both the
Armenian and Jewish merchants be weighed.
This done, Mehmet Ali Pasha took note of
their respective weights. The Jew weighed
fifty okes and the Armenian sixty okes. He
then discharged them, saying that he would
send for them later on.</p>

<p>The Armenian waited patiently for a month
or two, but no summons came from the Pasha.
Every Friday he endeavored to meet the Pasha
so as to bring the case to his mind, but without
avail; for the Pasha, perceiving him from
a distance, would turn away his head or otherwise
purposely avoid catching his eye. At
last, after about eight months of anxious waiting,
the Armenian and the Jew were summoned
to appear before the court. Mehmet
Ali Pasha, in opening the case, called in the
Public Weigher and had them weighed again.
On this occasion it was found that the Armenian
had decreased, now only weighing
fifty okes, for worry makes a man grow thin;
but the Jew, on the contrary, had put on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
several okes. These facts were gravely considered,
and the Pasha accused the Jew of
having received the money and at once ordered
the brass pot to be heated and placed
on his head to force confession. The Jew
did not care to submit to this fearful ordeal,
so he confessed that he had not repaid the
debt, and had to do so then and there.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/tcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p>here once lived a farmer who understood
the language of animals.
He had obtained this knowledge
on condition that he would never
reveal its possession, and with the further provision
that should he prove false to his oath
the penalty would be certain death.</p>

<p>One day he chanced to listen to a conversation
his ox and his horse were having. The
ox had just come in from a weary and hard
day's work in the rain.</p>

<p>"Oh," sighed the ox, looking over to the
horse, "how fortunate you are to have been
born a horse and not an ox. When the
weather is bad you are kept in the stable,
well fed, groomed every morning, and caressed
every evening. Oh that I were a horse!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
"What you say is true," replied the horse,
"but you are very stupid to work so hard."</p>

<p>"You do not know what it is to be goaded
with a spear and howled at, or you would not
accuse me of being stupid to work so hard,"
replied the ox.</p>

<p>"Then why don't you feign sickness," continued
the horse.</p>

<p>On the following day the ox determined to
try this deceit, but he was stung with remorse
when he saw the horse led out to take his
place at the plough. In the evening, when
the horse was brought to the stable very tired,
the ox sympathized with him, and regretted
his being the cause, but at the same time
expressed astonishment at his working so hard.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend, I had to work hard; I
can't bear the whip; the thought of the
hideous crack! crack! makes me shiver even
now," answered the horse.</p>

<p>"But leaving that aside, my poor horned
friend," proceeded the horse, "I am now
most anxious for you. I heard the master<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
say to-night that if you were not well in the
morning, the butcher was to come and slaughter
you."</p>

<p>"You need not worry about me, friend
horse," said the ox, "as I much prefer the
yoke to chewing the cud of self-reproach."</p>

<p>At this point the farmer left the animals
and entered his home, smiling at his own wily
craft in re-establishing, if not contentedness,
at least resignation to their fate, in the stable.
Meeting his wife, she at once inquired as
to the cause of his happy smile. He put
her off, first with one excuse then with another,
but to no avail; the more he protested,
the stronger her inquisitiveness grew. Her
unsatisfied curiosity at length made her ill.
The endeavors of the numerous doctors
brought to her assistance were as futile as
the incantations of the sages from far and
near, and as powerless to remove the spell
as were the amulets, the charms, and the
abracadabras conceived and written by holy
men. The evil prompting gnawed her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
and she visibly pined away. The poor
farmer was distracted. Rather than see her
die, he at last decided to tell her, and
forfeit his own life to save hers. Deeply dejected,
for no man quits this planet without
a pang, he sat at the window gazing, as he
thought, for the last time on the familiar
surroundings. Of a sudden he noticed his
favorite chanticleer, followed by his numerous
harem, sadly strutting about, only allowing
his favorites to eat the morsels he discovered,
and ruthlessly driving the others away. To
one he said: "I am not like our poor master,
to be ruled by one or a score of you. He, poor
man, will die to-day for revealing his secret
knowledge to save her life."</p>

<p>"What is the secret knowledge?" asked one
of the wives; and the chanticleer flew at her
and thrashed her mercilessly, saying at each
vigorous blow, "That is the secret, and if our
master only treated the mistress as I treat you,
he would not need to give up his life to-day."</p>

<p>And as if maddened at the thought, he beat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
them all in turn. The master, seeing and
appreciating the effect from the window,
went to his wife and treated her in precisely
the same manner. And this effected what
neither doctors, sages, nor holy men could
do&mdash;it cured her.</p>

</div><p>here once lived a Hodja who, it
was said, understood the language
of birds, but refused to impart his
knowledge. One young man was
very persistent in his desire to know the language
of these sweet creatures, but the Hodja
was inflexible.</p>

<p>In despair, the young man went to the
woods at least to listen to the pleasant chirping
of the birds. By degrees it conveyed to
him a meaning, till, finally, he understood
them to tell him that his horse would die.
On returning from the woods, he immediately
sold his horse and went and told the
Hodja.</p>

<p>"Oh Hodja, why will you not teach me the
language of birds? Yesterday I went to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
woods and they warned me that my horse
would die, thus affording me an opportunity
of selling it and avoiding the loss."</p>

<p>The Hodja was silent, but would not give
way.</p>

<p>The following day the young man again
went to the woods, and the chirping of the
birds told him that his house would be burned.
The young man hurried away, sold his house,
again went to the Hodja and told him all that
had happened, adding:</p>

<p>"See, Hodja Effendi, you would not teach
me the language of the birds, but I have saved
my horse and my house by listening to them."</p>

<p>On the following day, the young man again
went to the woods, and the birds chirped him
the doleful tale, that on the following day he
would die. In tears the young man went to
the Hodja for advice.</p>

<p>"Oh Hodja Effendi! Alas! What am I to
do? The birds have told me that to-morrow
I must die."</p>

<p>"My son," answered the Hodja, "I knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
this would come, and that is why I refused to
teach you the language of birds. Had you
borne the loss of your horse, your house would
have been saved, and had your house been
burned, your life would have been saved."</p>

</div><p> man one day saw a swallow and
caught it. The bird pleaded hard
for liberty, saying:</p>

<p>"If thou wilt let me go, thy
gain will be great, for I will give thee three
counsels that will hereafter be of use to thee."</p>

<p>The man listened to the bird and let it go.
Flying to a tree close by it perched on a
branch, and said:</p>

<p>"Hearken and give thine ear to the three
advices that will guide thee. The first is, do
not believe things that are incredible; the
second is, do not attempt to stretch out thine
hand to a place thou art unable to reach; and
the third advice I give thee is, do not pine
after a thing that is past and gone. Take
these my counsels and do not forget them."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
The bird then tempted the man, saying:
"Inside of me there is a large pearl of great
value; it is both magnificent and splendid,
and as large as the egg of a kite."</p>

<p>Now, hearing this, the man repented at
having let the bird go, the color of his face
went to sadness, and he at once stretched out
his hand to catch the swallow, but the latter
said to the foolish man:</p>

<p>"What! Hast thou already forgotten the
advice I gave thee, and the lie which I told
thee, hast thou considered as true? I had
fallen into thy hands, yet thou wert unable to
retain me, and now thou art sorrowing for
the past for which there is no remedy."</p>

<p>Such are those that worship idols, and give
the name of God to their own handiwork.

</div><p>n the age of the Janissaries the Minister
of War, in all haste, called
the chief farrier of the Army and
ordered him to have made immediately
two hundred thousand horseshoes.
The farrier was aghast, and explained that to
make such a quantity of horseshoes, both time
and smiths would be required. The Minister
replied:</p>

<p>"It is the order of his Majesty that these
two hundred thousand horseshoes be ready by
to-morrow; if not, your head will pay the
penalty."</p>

<p>The poor farrier replied, that knowing now
that he was doomed he would be unable,
through nervousness, to make even a fifth of
the number. The Minister would not listen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to reason, and left in anger, reiterating the
order of his Majesty.</p>

<p>The farrier retired to his rooms deeply
dejected. His wife, woman-like, endeavored
to encourage and comfort him, saying:</p>

<p>"Cheer up, husband, drink your raki, eat
your m&eacute;z&eacute;, and be cheerful, for we know not
what the dawn may bring forth."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the farrier, "the dawn will not
bring forth two hundred thousand horseshoes,
and my head will pay the penalty."</p>

<p>Late that night there was a tremendous
knocking at his door. The poor farrier
thought that it was an inquiry as to how
many horseshoes were already made, and
trembling with fear went and opened the door.
What was his surprise, when on opening the
door and inquiring the object of the visit, to
be greeted with:</p>

<p>"Haste, farrier, let us have sixteen nails,
for the Minister of War has been suddenly
removed to Paradise by the hand of Allah."</p>

<p>The farrier gathered, not sixteen but forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
nails of the best he had, and, handing them
to the messenger, said:</p>

will not get up again, for had not this happened,
the nails would have been required to
keep me in my coffin."</p>

<h2><a name="OLD_MEN_MADE_YOUNG" id="OLD_MEN_MADE_YOUNG"></a>OLD MEN MADE YOUNG</h2>


<div class="figleft"><img src="images/icap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><p>n Psamatia, an ancient Armenian
village situated near the Seven
Towers, there lived a certain
smith, whose custom it was, in
contradiction to prescribed rules, to curse the
devil and his works regularly five times a day
instead of praying to God. He argued that
it is the devil's fault that man had need to
pray. The devil was angered at being thus
persistently cursed, and decided to punish
the smith, or at least prevent his causing
further trouble.</p>

<p>Taking the form of a young man he went to
the smith and engaged himself as an apprentice.
After a time the devil told the smith
that he had a very poor and mean way of
earning a living, and that he would show him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
how money was to be made. The smith
asked what he, a young apprentice, could do.
Thereupon the devil told him that he was
endowed with a great gift: the power to make
old men young again. Though incredulous,
after continued assurance the smith allowed
a sign to be put above his door, stating that
aged people could here be restored to youth.
This extraordinary sign attracted a great many,
but the devil asked such high prices that most
went away, preferring age to parting with so
much money.</p>

<p>At last one old man agreed to pay the sum
demanded by the devil, whereupon he was
promptly cast into the furnace, the master-smith
blowing the bellows for a small remuneration.
After a time of vigorous blowing
the devil raked out a young man. The fame
of the smith extended far and wide, and many
were the aged that came to regain their youth.
This lucrative business went on for some
time, and at last the smith, thinking to himself
that it was not a difficult thing to throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a man into the furnace and rake him out from
the ashes restored to youth, decided to do away
with his apprentice's services, but kept the sign
above the door.</p>

<p>It happened that the captain of the Janissaries,
who was a very aged man, came to him,
and after bargaining for a much more modest
sum than his apprentice would have asked, the
smith thrust him into the furnace as the devil,
his apprentice, used to do, and worked at the
bellows. He afterwards raked in the fire for
the young man but he only raked out cinders
and ashes. Great was his consternation, but
what could he do?</p>

<p>The devil in the meantime went to the head
of the Janissaries and the police, and informed
them of what had taken place. The poor
smith was arrested, tried, and condemned to
be bowstrung, as it was proved that the Janissary
was last seen to enter his shop.</p>

<p>Just as the smith was about to be executed,
the devil again appeared before him in the form
of the discharged apprentice, and asked him if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
he wished to be saved; if so, that he could
save him, but on one condition only,&mdash;that
he ceased from cursing the devil five times
a day and pray as other Mussulmans prayed.
He agreed. Thereupon the apprentice called
in a loud voice to those who were about to
execute him: "What will you of this man?
He has not killed the Janissary; he is not
dead, for I have just seen him entering his
home." This was found to be true, and the
smith was liberated, learning the truth of the
proverb, 'Curse not even the devil.'</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/tcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><p>here once lived in Stamboul a
man and wife who were so well
mated that though married for a
number of years their life was one
of ideal harmony. This troubled the devil
very much. He had destroyed the peace of
home after home; he had successfully created,
between husband and wife, father and son and
brothers, the chasm of envy wide and deep,
so wide that the bridge of life could not span
the gap. In this one little home alone did
he fail in spite of his greatest endeavor. One
day the devil was talking to an old woman,
when the man who had thus far baffled him
passed by. The devil groaned at the thought
of his repeated failures. Turning to the old
woman he said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
"I will give you as a reward a pair of yellow
slippers if you make that man quarrel with his
wife."</p>

<p>The old woman was delighted, and at once
began to scheme and work for the coveted
slippers. At an hour when she was sure to
find the lady alone, she went and solicited
alms, weeping and bemoaning her sad fate at
being a lonely old woman whose husband was
long since dead. She appealed to the lady
for compassion in proportion as she hoped for
the duration of the cup she and her husband
quaffed in undivided happiness. The lady
was very generous to the old woman, each
day giving her something; so much so, that
the thought that her good husband might
think her extravagant often gave her some
uneasiness.</p>

<p>One day the old woman looked into the
shop-door of her benefactress's husband and
planted the first evil seed by calling out:</p>

<p>"Ah! if men only knew where the money
they work for from morning till night goes, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
knew what their wives did when they were
away, some homes would not be so happy."</p>

<p>The evil woman then went her way, and the
good shopman wondered why she had said
these words to him. A passing thought suggested
that it was strange that of late his wife
had asked him several times for a few extra
piasters. The next day, the old woman as
usual solicited alms of her victim. In the
fulness of her hypocrisy she embraced the
young lady before departing, taking care to
leave the imprint of her blackened hand on
her dupe's back. The old woman then again
went to the shop, looked at her victim's husband,
and said:</p>

<p>"Oh! how blind men are! They only look
in a woman's face for truth and loyalty; they
forget to look at the back where the stamp of
the lover's hand is to be seen."</p>

<p>As before, the old woman disappeared. But
the mind of the shopman was troubled and
his heart was heavy. In this oppressed state he
went to his home, and an opportunity offering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
he looked at his wife's back, and was aghast
to see there the impression of a hand. He
got up and left his home, a broken-hearted
man.</p>

<p>The devil was deeply impressed at the signal
success of the old woman, and hastened
to redeem his promise. He took a long pole,
tied the pair of slippers at the end, and hurried
off to the old woman. Arriving at her
house he called out to her to open the window.
When she did this, he thrust in the
pair of yellow slippers, begging her to take
them, but not to come near him; they were
hard-earned slippers, he said; she had succeeded
where he had failed; so that he was
afraid of her and was anxious to keep out of
her way.</p>

dear this year."</p>

<p>In answer to this, the devil shook his long
tail in the air, and lo, little seeds began to
fall like hail from the sky.</p>

<p>"I hope," said the devil, "that I have
gained my wager."</p>

<p>"Bah," answered the peasant, "what's the
good of that? These seeds might be lost.
You do not take into consideration frost,
blighting winds, drought, damp, storms,
diseases of plants, and other things. How
can I judge as yet?"</p>

<p>"Behold," said the devil, "in this box are
both sun and rain, take it and use it as you
please."</p>

<p>The peasant did so and to very good purpose,
for his corn soon ripened and up to that
time he had never seen so good a harvest.
But the corn of his neighbors had also prospered
from the rain and sun.</p>

<p>At harvest time the devil came, and saw
that the man was looking with envious eyes at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
his neighbor's fields where the corn was as
good as his own.</p>

<p>"Have you been able to obtain what you
desired?" asked the devil.</p>

<p>"Alas!" answered the man, "all the barns
will break down under the weight of the
sheaves. The grain will be sold at a low
price. This fine harvest will make me sit
on ashes."</p>

<p>While he was speaking, the devil had taken
an ear of corn from the ground and was crushing
it in his hand, and as soon as he blew on
the grains they all turned into pure gold.
The peasant took up one and examined it
attentively on all sides, and then in a despairing
tone cried out: "Oh, my God! I must
spend money to melt all these and send them
to the mint."</p>

<p>The devil wrung his hands in despair. He
had lost his wager. He could do everything,
but he could not make a contented man.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/bcap.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="B" title="B" />
</div><p>ekri Mustafe, who lived during
the reign of Sultan Selim, was
a celebrated toper, and perhaps
at that time the only Moslem
drunkard in Turkey. Consequently, he was
often the subject of conversation in circles
both high and low. It happened that his
Majesty the Sultan had occasion to speak to
Bekri one day, and he asked him what pleasure
he found in drinking so much raki, and why
he disobeyed the laws of the Prophet. Bekri
replied that raki was a boon to man; that it
made the deaf to hear, the blind to see, the
lame to walk, and the poor rich, and that he,
Bekri, when drunk, could hear, see, and walk
like two Bekris. The Sultan, to verify the
truth of this statement, sent his servants into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
the highways to bring four men, the one blind,
the other deaf, the third lame, and the fourth
poor. Directly these were brought, his Majesty
ordered raki to be served to them in
company with Bekri. They had not been
drinking long when, to the glory of Bekri, the
deaf man said: "I hear the sound of great
rumbling."</p>

<p>And the blind man replied: "I can see him;
it is an enemy who seeks our destruction."</p>

<p>The lame man asked where he was, saying,
"Show him to me, and I will quickly despatch
him."</p>

<p>And the poor man called out: "Don't be
afraid to kill him; I've got his blood money
in my pocket."</p>

<p>Just then a funeral happened to pass by the
Palace buildings, and Bekri got up and ordered
the solemn procession to stop. Removing
the lid of the coffin, he whispered a
few words into the ear of the dead man, and
then putting his ear to the dead man's mouth,
vented an exclamation of surprise. He then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
ordered the funeral to proceed, and returned
to the Palace.</p>

<p>The Sultan asked him what he had said to
the dead man, and what the dead man replied.</p>

<p>"I simply asked him where he was going
and from what he had died, and he replied
he was going to Paradise, and that he had
died from drinking raki without a m&eacute;z&eacute;."</p>

<p>Whereupon the Sultan understanding what
he wanted, ordered that the m&eacute;z&eacute; should be
immediately served.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
